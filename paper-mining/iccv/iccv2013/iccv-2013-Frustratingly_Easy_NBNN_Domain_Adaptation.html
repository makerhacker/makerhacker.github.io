[sent-29, score-0.115]
</p><p>9 Even though the domain adaptation/dataset bias problem is clearly at its core a generalization problem, the almost totality of approaches presented so far use image-to-image learning algorithms on top of BOW representations. [sent-32, score-0.285]
</p><p>10 Here we turn the table around: instead of considering a descriptor and trying to amend the issues that it generates with image-to-image distance based learning methods, we show that the NBNN method is a priori more robust to visual domain shift. [sent-33, score-0.293]
</p><p>11 Experiments on existing domain adaptation databases confirm our intuition: on all of them, the NBNN classifier obtains strong results, often achieving the state of the art. [sent-34, score-0.516]

</p><p>14 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: after reviewing previous work (section 2) we set the notation and show with a proofofconcept experiment that the mere plugand-play of the NBNN classifier leads to remarkable results on the domain adaptation problem (section 3).

</p><p>15 Section 4 describes our NBNN-based domain adaptation algorithm, and section 5 reports the experiments showing the strength of the original NBNN classifier on two different settings, as well as the added value brought by our algorithm. [sent-38, score-0.466]
</p><p>16 Related Work Domain adaptation is a widely researched problem. [sent-41, score-0.202]
</p><p>17 The field is infact becoming increasingly aware of the dataset bias issue [25]: existing image collections used for object categorization present specific characteristics which prevent cross-dataset generalization. [sent-45, score-0.103]
</p><p>18 They define several procedures to transform the input features such that different domains become similar and any classifier can be proficiently applied. [sent-48, score-0.119]
</p><p>19 In [22] the key idea is to learn a regularized transformation using informationtheoretic metric learning that maps source data to the target domain. [sent-49, score-0.252]
</p><p>20 [13] proposed to project both the source and target domain samples onto a set of intermediate subspaces, while Gong et al. [sent-51, score-0.462]
</p><p>21 Another stream of works propose classifier adaptation ap-  proaches. [sent-53, score-0.25]
</p><p>22 Here the authors learn a a model composed of a general and a specific part, taking care of the dataset bias at training time. [sent-56, score-0.088]
</p><p>23 This representation allows to reach state of the art results (even combined with SPM [16]) over in-domain problems, but its use for crossdomain tasks may not be beneficial. [sent-58, score-0.093]
</p><p>24 As pointed out in [20, 19], a visual word dictionary built on the source set may be a bad reference for local descriptor extracted from the target. [sent-59, score-0.135]
</p><p>25 The NBNN classifier was introduced to overcome both these problems and it has shown top performances when applied on visual object categorization tasks. [sent-64, score-0.085]
</p><p>26 Our work fits in this context: we focus on the suitability of NBNN for domain adaptation and we propose an algorithm that further exploits the NBNN specific features. [sent-66, score-0.439]

</p><p>35 NBNN-based Domain Adaptation Our main intuition is that the distribution of local features per class may be similar across two domains despite  the variation between the respective image distributions. [sent-125, score-0.116]
</p><p>36 This similarity can also be enhanced by a domain adaptation approach in the NBNN setting. [sent-126, score-0.418]
</p><p>37 With this goal in mind, we start from the metric learning method proposed in [27] and we extend it to deal with two domains. [sent-127, score-0.081]
</p><p>38 Inspired by [7] we propose a greedy algorithm which progressively selects an increasing number of target instances and combines it with a subset of the source data while learning iteratively a Mahalanobis metric per class. [sent-128, score-0.317]
</p><p>39 When facing an unsupervised crossdomain problem several labeled samples of a source set S : {Fl , yl }lL=1 are available together with unlabeled samples {oFf the target set T : {Fu}uU=1 . [sent-131, score-0.37]
</p><p>40 By applying the NBNN algorithm, twaritghe t sheet source l}ocal features as training1 , we can estimate the label for each target sample according to (2). [sent-132, score-0.192]
</p><p>41 The data subsets Sk and Tk extracted from the two domains can then be used to learn a specific Mahalanobis metric per class which induces for each sample a large margin separation between the image-to-class distance of the correct (or estimated) class (p) and all the other classes (n). [sent-133, score-0.423]
</p><p>42 The metrics are coded in the matrices Wc ∈ Rd×d for  1For NBNN (and NN) there  is no real training phase, but we refer to the available labeled samples as training set, generalizing from the standard statistical learning terminology. [sent-134, score-0.118]

</p><p>44 At each of the k iterations, NBNN predicts on the unlabeled target samples in Uk. [sent-136, score-0.133]
</p><p>45 Two samples from Uk and two samples from Sk are then respectively added to, and removed from the training set, depending on the difference between the negative and positive distances. [sent-137, score-0.122]
</p><p>46 We follow the formulation in [27], but we keep the source and target samples separated with different parameters λs,λt and relative weights Γs (k),Γt (k) such that the full objective reads like this O(W1, W2, . [sent-145, score-0.221]
</p><p>47 At the first round the labels predicted for the target samples may not be fully reliable. [sent-161, score-0.171]
</p><p>48 On the other hand, we want the source sample importance to decrease in time. [sent-168, score-0.109]
</p><p>49 We clarify here how the samples are extracted from the two domains to define the sets Sk and Tk . [sent-171, score-0.145]

</p><p>53 This procedure is repeated at each round k and the described samples are progressively moved from Uk to Tk+1, thus helping to tune the metric at the following iteration and adapting it to solve the target problem. [sent-180, score-0.294]
</p><p>54 While focusing on the target, the source information should become less and less relevant. [sent-181, score-0.088]
</p><p>55 In practice we identify and delete the source sample lying far from the margin bound and which have low probability to affect its position. [sent-190, score-0.156]
</p><p>56 The combination of metric learning and sample selection define our DA-NBNN algorithm. [sent-192, score-0.102]
</p><p>57 Each process helps the other: by tuning Wc we adjust the image-to-class distance, while by changing the training data we redefine the local feature set for each class, making it progressively more suitable for the target domain. [sent-193, score-0.148]

</p><p>62 The obtained 64-dimensional descriptors are then used with a 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier in two different ways, without including any spatial information: BOW: for each domain we constructed a 800-visual-word vocabulary by k-means on a random subset of the data. [sent-220, score-0.329]

Our method directly optimizes for classification in the target domain. The key insight is finding attributes that are discriminative across categories and predictable across domains. We achieve a performance that significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. In fact, in many cases, our method reaches the same-domain performance, the upper bound, in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios.</p><p>3 0.22195143 <a title="181-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_by_Domain_Invariant_Projection.html">435 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection</a></p>

Lovell, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: Domain-invariant representations are key to addressing the domain shift problem where the training and test examples follow different distributions. Existing techniques that have attempted to match the distributions of the source and target domains typically compare these distributions in the original feature space. This space, however, may not be directly suitable for such a comparison, since some of the features may have been distorted by the domain shift, or may be domain specific. In this paper, we introduce a Domain Invariant Projection approach: An unsupervised domain adaptation method that overcomes this issue by extracting the information that is invariant across the source and target domains. More specifically, we learn a projection of the data to a low-dimensional latent space where the distance between the empirical distributions of the source and target examples is minimized. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of visual object recognition and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a standard domain adaptation benchmark dataset.</p><p>4 0.22116393 <a title="181-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Visual_Domain_Adaptation_Using_Subspace_Alignment.html">438 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Visual Domain Adaptation Using Subspace Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Andy J. Ma, Pong C. Yuen, Jiawei Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses a new person re-identification problem without the label information of persons under non-overlapping target cameras. Given the matched (positive) and unmatched (negative) image pairs from source domain cameras, as well as unmatched (negative) image pairs which can be easily generated from target domain cameras, we propose a Domain Transfer Ranked Support Vector Machines (DTRSVM) method for re-identification under target domain cameras. To overcome the problems introduced due to the absence of matched (positive) image pairs in target domain, we relax the discriminative constraint to a necessary condition only relying on the positive mean in target domain. By estimating the target positive mean using source and target domain data, a new discriminative model with high confidence in target positive mean and low confidence in target negative image pairs is developed. Since the necessary condition may not truly preserve the discriminability, multi-task support vector ranking is proposed to incorporate the training data from source domain with label information. Experimental results show that the proposed DTRSVM outperforms existing methods without using label information in target cameras. And the top 30 rank accuracy can be improved by the proposed method upto 9.40% on publicly available person re-identification datasets.</p><p>6 0.10375664 <a title="181-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Adapting_Classification_Cascades_to_New_Domains.html">44 iccv-2013-Adapting Classification Cascades to New Domains</a></p>

<p>Author: Tatiana Tommasi, Barbara Caputo</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years, several authors have signaled that state of the art categorization methods fail to perform well when trained and tested on data from different databases. The general consensus in the literature is that this issue, known as domain adaptation and/or dataset bias, is due to a distribution mismatch between data collections. Methods addressing it go from max-margin classifiers to learning how to modify the features and obtain a more robust representation. The large majority of these works use BOW feature descriptors, and learning methods based on imageto-image distance functions. Following the seminal work of [6], in this paper we challenge these two assumptions. We experimentally show that using the NBNN classifier over existing domain adaptation databases achieves always very strong performances. We build on this result, and present an NBNN-based domain adaptation algorithm that learns iteratively a class metric while inducing, for each sample, a large margin separation among classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work casting the domain adaptation problem within the NBNN framework.

<p>Author: Fatemeh Mirrashed, Mohammad Rastegari</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method that exploits intrinsic compact structures of categories across different domains using binary attributes. Our method directly optimizes for classification in the target domain. The key insight is finding attributes that are discriminative across categories and predictable across domains. We achieve a performance that significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. In fact, in many cases, our method reaches the same-domain performance, the upper bound, in unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios.</p><p>3 0.90890515 <a title="181-lsi-3" href="./iccv-2013-Transfer_Feature_Learning_with_Joint_Distribution_Adaptation.html">427 iccv-2013-Transfer Feature Learning with Joint Distribution Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Guiguang Ding, Jiaguang Sun, Philip S. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Transfer learning is established as an effective technology in computer visionfor leveraging rich labeled data in the source domain to build an accurate classifier for the target domain. However, most prior methods have not simultaneously reduced the difference in both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution between domains. In this paper, we put forward a novel transfer learning approach, referred to as Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA). Specifically, JDA aims to jointly adapt both the marginal distribution and conditional distribution in a principled dimensionality reduction procedure, and construct new feature representation that is effective and robustfor substantial distribution difference. Extensive experiments verify that JDA can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art methods on four types of cross-domain image classification problems.</p><p>4 0.90642565 <a title="181-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_by_Domain_Invariant_Projection.html">435 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Domain Invariant Projection</a></p>

<p>Author: Quanfu Fan, Prasad Gabbur, Sharath Pankanti</p><p>Abstract: Effective reduction of false alarms in large-scale video surveillance is rather challenging, especially for applications where abnormal events of interest rarely occur, such as abandoned object detection. We develop an approach to prioritize alerts by ranking them, and demonstrate its great effectiveness in reducing false positives while keeping good detection accuracy. Our approach benefits from a novel representation of abandoned object alerts by relative attributes, namely staticness, foregroundness and abandonment. The relative strengths of these attributes are quantified using a ranking function[19] learnt on suitably designed low-level spatial and temporal features.These attributes of varying strengths are not only powerful in distinguishing abandoned objects from false alarms such as people and light artifacts, but also computationally efficient for large-scale deployment. With these features, we apply a linear ranking algorithm to sort alerts according to their relevance to the end-user. We test the effectiveness of our approach on both public data sets and large ones collected from the real world.</p><p>3 0.77327323 <a title="181-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Complementary_Projection_Hashing.html">83 iccv-2013-Complementary Projection Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongming Jin, Yao Hu, Yue Lin, Debing Zhang, Shiding Lin, Deng Cai, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recently, hashing techniques have been widely applied to solve the approximate nearest neighbors search problem in many vision applications. Generally, these hashing approaches generate 2c buckets, where c is the length of the hash code. A good hashing method should satisfy the following two requirements: 1) mapping the nearby data points into the same bucket or nearby (measured by xue long l i opt . ac . cn @ a(a)b(b) the Hamming distance) buckets. 2) all the data points are evenly distributed among all the buckets. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Complementary Projection Hashing (CPH) to find the optimal hashing functions which explicitly considers the above two requirements. Specifically, CPHaims at sequentiallyfinding a series ofhyperplanes (hashing functions) which cross the sparse region of the data. At the same time, the data points are evenly distributed in the hypercubes generated by these hyperplanes. The experiments comparing with the state-of-the-art hashing methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p><p>4 0.76428032 <a title="181-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Ensemble_Projection_for_Semi-supervised_Image_Classification.html">142 iccv-2013-Ensemble Projection for Semi-supervised Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengxin Dai, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of semi-supervised classification. Unlike previous methods to regularize classifying boundaries with unlabeled data, our method learns a new image representation from all available data (labeled and unlabeled) andperformsplain supervised learning with the new feature. In particular, an ensemble of image prototype sets are sampled automatically from the available data, to represent a rich set of visual categories/attributes. Discriminative functions are then learned on these prototype sets, and image are represented by the concatenation of their projected values onto the prototypes (similarities to them) for further classification. Experiments on four standard datasets show three interesting phenomena: (1) our method consistently outperforms previous methods for semi-supervised image classification; (2) our method lets itself combine well with these methods; and (3) our method works well for self-taught image classification where unlabeled data are not coming from the same distribution as la- beled ones, but rather from a random collection of images.</p><p>5 0.75516427 <a title="181-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-From_Where_and_How_to_What_We_See.html">180 iccv-2013-From Where and How to What We See</a></p>
<p>Author: S. Karthikeyan, Vignesh Jagadeesh, Renuka Shenoy, Miguel Ecksteinz, B.S. Manjunath</p><p>Abstract: Eye movement studies have confirmed that overt attention is highly biased towards faces and text regions in images. In this paper we explore a novel problem of predicting face and text regions in images using eye tracking data from multiple subjects. The problem is challenging as we aim to predict the semantics (face/text/background) only from eye tracking data without utilizing any image information. The proposed algorithm spatially clusters eye tracking data obtained in an image into different coherent groups and subsequently models the likelihood of the clusters containing faces and text using afully connectedMarkov Random Field (MRF). Given the eye tracking datafrom a test image, itpredicts potential face/head (humans, dogs and cats) and text locations reliably. Furthermore, the approach can be used to select regions of interest for further analysis by object detectors for faces and text. The hybrid eye position/object detector approach achieves better detection performance and reduced computation time compared to using only the object detection algorithm. We also present a new eye tracking dataset on 300 images selected from ICDAR, Street-view, Flickr and Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset from 15 subjects.</p><p>6 0.75144923 <a title="181-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Unbiased_Metric_Learning%3A_On_the_Utilization_of_Multiple_Datasets_and_Web_Images_for_Softening_Bias.html">431 iccv-2013-Unbiased Metric Learning: On the Utilization of Multiple Datasets and Web Images for Softening Bias</a></p>
