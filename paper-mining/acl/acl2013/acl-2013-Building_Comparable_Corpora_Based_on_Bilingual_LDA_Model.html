<p>Author: Romain Deveaud ; Eric SanJuan ; Patrice Bellot</p><p>Abstract: The current topic modeling approaches for Information Retrieval do not allow to explicitly model query-oriented latent topics. More, the semantic coherence of the topics has never been considered in this field. We propose a model-based feedback approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models on the top-ranked pseudo-relevant feedback, and we measure the semantic coherence of those topics. We perform a first experimental evaluation using two major TREC test collections. Results show that retrieval perfor- mances tend to be better when using topics with higher semantic coherence.</p><p>3 0.18939398 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Text_Classification_based_on_the_Latent_Topics_of_Important_Sentences_extracted_by_the_PageRank_Algorithm.html">341 acl-2013-Text Classification based on the Latent Topics of Important Sentences extracted by the PageRank Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Yukari Ogura ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to raise the accuracy of text classification based on latent topics, reconsidering the techniques necessary for good classification for example, to decide important sentences in a document, the sentences with important words are usually regarded as important sentences. In this case, tf.idf is often used to decide important words. On the other hand, we apply the PageRank algorithm to rank important words in each document. Furthermore, before clustering documents, we refine the target documents by representing them as a collection of important sentences in each document. We then classify the documents based on latent information in the documents. As a clustering method, we employ the k-means algorithm and inves– tigate how our proposed method works for good clustering. We conduct experiments with Reuters-21578 corpus under various conditions of important sentence extraction, using latent and surface information for clustering, and have confirmed that our proposed method provides better result among various conditions for clustering.</p><p>4 0.17878324 <a title="74-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Latent_Semantic_Matching%3A_Application_to_Cross-language_Text_Categorization_without_Alignment_Information.html">217 acl-2013-Latent Semantic Matching: Application to Cross-language Text Categorization without Alignment Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Tsutomu Hirao ; Tomoharu Iwata ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised object matching (UOM) is a promising approach to cross-language natural language processing such as bilingual lexicon acquisition, parallel corpus construction, and cross-language text categorization, because it does not require labor-intensive linguistic resources. However, UOM only finds one-to-one correspondences from data sets with the same number of instances in source and target domains, and this prevents us from applying UOM to real-world cross-language natural language processing tasks. To alleviate these limitations, we proposes latent semantic matching, which embeds objects in both source and target language domains into a shared latent topic space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on cross-language text categorization. The results show that our method outperforms conventional unsupervised object matching methods.</p><p>5 0.16839927 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Broadcast_News_Story_Segmentation_Using_Manifold_Learning_on_Latent_Topic_Distributions.html">73 acl-2013-Broadcast News Story Segmentation Using Manifold Learning on Latent Topic Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoming Lu ; Lei Xie ; Cheung-Chi Leung ; Bin Ma ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: We present an efficient approach for broadcast news story segmentation using a manifold learning algorithm on latent topic distributions. The latent topic distribution estimated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to represent each text block. We employ Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) to project the latent topic distributions into low-dimensional semantic representations while preserving the intrinsic local geometric structure. We evaluate two approaches employing LDA and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) distributions respectively. The effects of different amounts of training data and different numbers of latent topics on the two approaches are studied. Experimental re- sults show that our proposed LDA-based approach can outperform the corresponding PLSA-based approach. The proposed approach provides the best performance with the highest F1-measure of 0.7860.</p><p>6 0.16132419 <a title="74-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Topic_Modeling_Based_Classification_of_Clinical_Reports.html">351 acl-2013-Topic Modeling Based Classification of Clinical Reports</a></p>

Some of these data are in the form of free text and require preprocessing to be able to used in automated systems. Efficient and effective use of this data could be vital to the speed and quality of health care. As a case study, we analyzed classification of CT imaging reports into binary categories. In addition to regular text classification, we utilized topic modeling of the entire dataset in various ways. Topic modeling of the corpora provides interpretable themes that exist in these reports. Representing reports according to their topic distributions is more compact than bag-of-words representation and can be processed faster than raw text in subsequent automated processes. A binary topic model was also built as an unsupervised classification approach with the assumption that each topic corresponds to a class. And, finally an aggregate topic classifier was built where reports are classified based on a single discriminative topic that is determined from the training dataset. Our proposed topic based classifier system is shown to be competitive with existing text classification techniques and provides a more efficient and interpretable representation.</p><p>5 0.80059069 <a title="74-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Broadcast_News_Story_Segmentation_Using_Manifold_Learning_on_Latent_Topic_Distributions.html">73 acl-2013-Broadcast News Story Segmentation Using Manifold Learning on Latent Topic Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Xia Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a probabilistic graphical model as an innovative framework for studying typological universals. We view language as a system and linguistic features as its components whose relationships are encoded in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Taking discovery of the word order universals as a knowledge discovery task we learn the graphical representation of a word order sub-system which reveals a finer structure such as direct and indirect dependencies among word order features. Then probabilistic inference enables us to see the strength of such relationships: given the observed value of one feature (or combination of features), the probabilities of values of other features can be calculated. Our model is not restricted to using only two values of a feature. Using imputation technique and EM algorithm it can handle missing val- ues well. Model averaging technique solves the problem of limited data. In addition the incremental and divide-and-conquer method addresses the areal and genetic effects simultaneously instead of separately as in Daumé III and Campbell (2007). 1</p><p>4 0.81546801 <a title="74-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-ImpAr%3A_A_Deterministic_Algorithm_for_Implicit_Semantic_Role_Labelling.html">189 acl-2013-ImpAr: A Deterministic Algorithm for Implicit Semantic Role Labelling</a></p>

The system exploits a very simple but relevant discursive property, the argument coherence over different instances of a predicate. The algorithm solves the implicit arguments sequentially, exploiting not only explicit but also the implicit arguments previously solved. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that the algorithm obtains very competitive and robust performances with respect to supervised approaches that require large amounts of costly training data.</p><p>5 0.80761427 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference_and_Efficient_Parsing_for_Tree-adjoining_Grammars.html">261 acl-2013-Nonparametric Bayesian Inference and Efficient Parsing for Tree-adjoining Grammars</a></p>

Our work shows performance improvements on the Penn Treebank and finds more compact yet linguistically rich representations of the data, but more importantly provides techniques in grammar transformation and statistical inference that make practical the use of these more expressive systems, thereby enabling further experimentation along these lines.</p><p>6 0.783337 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Translation_Competitions.html">250 acl-2013-Models of Translation Competitions</a></p>
