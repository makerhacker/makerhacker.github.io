<p>Author: Stephen Boxwell ; Dennis Mehay ; Chris Brew</p><p>Abstract: In many NLP systems, there is a unidirectional flow of information in which a parser supplies input to a semantic role labeler. In this paper, we build a system that allows information to flow in both directions. We make use of semantic role predictions in choosing a single-best parse. This process relies on an averaged perceptron model to distinguish likely semantic roles from erroneous ones. Our system penalizes parses that give rise to low-scoring semantic roles. To explore the consequences of this we perform two experiments. First, we use a baseline generative model to produce n-best parses, which are then re-ordered by our semantic model. Second, we use a modified version of our semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time. The performance of this modified labeler is weaker than that of our best full SRL, because it is restricted to features that can be computed directly from the parser’s packed chart. For both experiments, the resulting semantic predictions are then used to select parses. Finally, we feed the selected parses produced by each experiment to the full version of our semantic role labeler. We find that SRL performance can be improved over this baseline by selecting parses with likely semantic roles.</p><p>3 0.09333761 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Uptraining_for_Accurate_Deterministic_Question_Parsing.html">115 emnlp-2010-Uptraining for Accurate Deterministic Question Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Slav Petrov ; Pi-Chuan Chang ; Michael Ringgaard ; Hiyan Alshawi</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracies drop significantly on out-of-domain data. What is less known is that some parsers suffer more from domain shifts than others. We show that dependency parsers have more difficulty parsing questions than constituency parsers. In particular, deterministic shift-reduce dependency parsers, which are of highest interest for practical applications because of their linear running time, drop to 60% labeled accuracy on a question test set. We propose an uptraining procedure in which a deterministic parser is trained on the output of a more accurate, but slower, latent variable constituency parser (converted to dependencies). Uptraining with 100K unlabeled questions achieves results comparable to having 2K labeled questions for training. With 100K unlabeled and 2K labeled questions, uptraining is able to improve parsing accuracy to 84%, closing the gap between in-domain and out-of-domain performance.</p><p>4 0.086409159 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Top-Down_Nearly-Context-Sensitive_Parsing.html">106 emnlp-2010-Top-Down Nearly-Context-Sensitive Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Eugene Charniak</p><p>Abstract: We present a new syntactic parser that works left-to-right and top down, thus maintaining a fully-connected parse tree for a few alternative parse hypotheses. All of the commonly used statistical parsers use context-free dynamic programming algorithms and as such work bottom up on the entire sentence. Thus they only find a complete fully connected parse at the very end. In contrast, both subjective and experimental evidence show that people understand a sentence word-to-word as they go along, or close to it. The constraint that the parser keeps one or more fully connected syntactic trees is intended to operationalize this cognitive fact. Our parser achieves a new best result for topdown parsers of 89.4%,a 20% error reduction over the previous single-parser best result for parsers of this type of 86.8% (Roark, 2001) . The improved performance is due to embracing the very large feature set available in exchange for giving up dynamic programming.</p><p>5 0.085701041 <a title="21-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Utilizing_Extra-Sentential_Context_for_Parsing.html">118 emnlp-2010-Utilizing Extra-Sentential Context for Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic consistency is the preference to reuse a syntactic construction shortly after its appearance in a discourse. We present an analysis of the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, and show that syntactic consistency is pervasive across productions with various lefthand side nonterminals. Then, we implement a reranking constituent parser that makes use of extra-sentential context in its feature set. Using a linear-chain conditional random field, we improve parsing accuracy over the generative baseline parser on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus, rivalling a similar model that does not make use of context. We show that the context-aware and the context-ignorant rerankers perform well on different subsets of the evaluation data, suggesting a combined approach would provide further improvement. We also compare parses made by models, and suggest that context can be useful for parsing by capturing structural dependencies between sentences as opposed to lexically governed dependencies.</p><p>6 0.084416345 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Non-Isomorphic_Forest_Pair_Translation.html">86 emnlp-2010-Non-Isomorphic Forest Pair Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Pawel Mazur ; Robert Dale</p><p>Abstract: The reliable extraction of knowledge from text requires an appropriate treatment of the time at which reported events take place. Unfortunately, there are very few annotated data sets that support the development of techniques for event time-stamping and tracking the progression of time through a narrative. In this paper, we present a new corpus of temporally-rich documents sourced from English Wikipedia, which we have annotated with TIMEX2 tags. The corpus contains around 120000 tokens, and 2600 TIMEX2 expressions, thus comparing favourably in size to other existing corpora used in these areas. We describe the prepa- ration of the corpus, and compare the profile of the data with other existing temporally annotated corpora. We also report the results obtained when we use DANTE, our temporal expression tagger, to process this corpus, and point to where further work is required. The corpus is publicly available for research purposes.</p><p>3 0.43119106 <a title="21-lsi-3" href="./emnlp-2010-We%27re_Not_in_Kansas_Anymore%3A_Detecting_Domain_Changes_in_Streams.html">119 emnlp-2010-We're Not in Kansas Anymore: Detecting Domain Changes in Streams</a></p>

<p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Ari Rappoport</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel training algorithm for unsupervised grammar induction, called Zoomed Learning. Given a training set T and a test set S, the goal of our algorithm is to identify subset pairs Ti, Si of T and S such that when the unsupervised parser is trained on a training subset Ti its results on its paired test subset Si are better than when it is trained on the entire training set T. A successful application of zoomed learning improves overall performance on the full test set S. We study our algorithm’s effect on the leading algorithm for the task of fully unsupervised parsing (Seginer, 2007) in three different English domains, WSJ, BROWN and GENIA, and show that it improves the parser F-score by up to 4.47%.</p><p>6 0.37481415 <a title="21-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-SRL-Based_Verb_Selection_for_ESL.html">95 emnlp-2010-SRL-Based Verb Selection for ESL</a></p>

<p>Author: Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Rohit Prasad ; David Stallard ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: Production of parallel training corpora for the development of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems for resource-poor languages usually requires extensive manual effort. Active sample selection aims to reduce the labor, time, and expense incurred in producing such resources, attaining a given performance benchmark with the smallest possible training corpus by choosing informative, nonredundant source sentences from an available candidate pool for manual translation. We present a novel, discriminative sample selection strategy that preferentially selects batches of candidate sentences with constructs that lead to erroneous translations on a held-out development set. The proposed strategy supports a built-in diversity mechanism that reduces redundancy in the selected batches. Simulation experiments on English-to-Pashto and Spanish-to-English translation tasks demon- strate the superiority of the proposed approach to a number of competing techniques, such as random selection, dissimilarity-based selection, as well as a recently proposed semisupervised active learning strategy.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81310797 <a title="21-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Discovery_of_Manner_Relations_and_its_Applications.html">21 emnlp-2010-Automatic Discovery of Manner Relations and its Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Longhua Qian ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Seed sampling is critical in semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes a clusteringbased stratified seed sampling approach to semi-supervised learning. First, various clustering algorithms are explored to partition the unlabeled instances into different strata with each stratum represented by a center. Then, diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling is adopted to choose the center and additional instances from each stratum to form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate. Finally, the labeled seed set is fed into a bootstrapping procedure as the initial labeled data. We systematically evaluate our stratified bootstrapping approach in the semantic relation classification subtask of the ACE RDC (Relation Detection and Classification) task. In particular, we compare various clustering algorithms on the stratified bootstrapping performance. Experimental results on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus show that our clusteringbased stratified bootstrapping approach achieves the best F1-score of 75.9 on the subtask of semantic relation classification, approaching the one with golden clustering.</p><p>4 0.37361875 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Classifying_Dialogue_Acts_in_One-on-One_Live_Chats.html">26 emnlp-2010-Classifying Dialogue Acts in One-on-One Live Chats</a></p>
<p>Author: Su Nam Kim ; Lawrence Cavedon ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: We explore the task of automatically classifying dialogue acts in 1-on-1 online chat forums, an increasingly popular means of providing customer service. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of various features and machine learners for this task. While a simple bag-of-words approach provides a solid baseline, we find that adding information from dialogue structure and inter-utterance dependency provides some increase in performance; learners that account for sequential dependencies (CRFs) show the best performance. We report our results from testing using a corpus of chat dialogues derived from online shopping customer-feedback data.</p><p>5 0.36790481 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-SRL-Based_Verb_Selection_for_ESL.html">95 emnlp-2010-SRL-Based Verb Selection for ESL</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Bo Han ; Kuan Li ; Stephan Hyeonjun Stiller ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop an approach to tackle the problem of verb selection for learners of English as a second language (ESL) by using features from the output of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). Unlike existing approaches to verb selection that use local features such as n-grams, our approach exploits semantic features which explicitly model the usage context of the verb. The verb choice highly depends on its usage context which is not consistently captured by local features. We then combine these semantic features with other local features under the generalized perceptron learning framework. Experiments on both indomain and out-of-domain corpora show that our approach outperforms the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>6 0.36676055 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Negative_Categories_in_Lexicon_Bootstrapping.html">112 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Discovery of Negative Categories in Lexicon Bootstrapping</a></p>
