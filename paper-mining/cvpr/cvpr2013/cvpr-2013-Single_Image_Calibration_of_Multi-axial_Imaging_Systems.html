<p>Author: Filippo Bergamasco, Andrea Albarelli, Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello</p><p>Abstract: Traditional camera models are often the result of a compromise between the ability to account for non-linearities in the image formation model and the need for a feasible number of degrees of freedom in the estimation process. These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><p>4 0.29089588 <a title="400-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Theory_of_Refractive_Photo-Light-Path_Triangulation.html">27 cvpr-2013-A Theory of Refractive Photo-Light-Path Triangulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Visesh Chari, Peter Sturm</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction of transparent refractive objects like a plastic bottle is challenging: they lack appearance related visual cues and merely reflect and refract light from the surrounding environment. Amongst several approaches to reconstruct such objects, the seminal work of Light-Path triangulation [17] is highly popular because of its general applicability and analysis of minimal scenarios. A lightpath is defined as the piece-wise linear path taken by a ray of light as it passes from source, through the object and into the camera. Transparent refractive objects not only affect the geometric configuration of light-paths but also their radiometric properties. In this paper, we describe a method that combines both geometric and radiometric information to do reconstruction. We show two major consequences of the addition of radiometric cues to the light-path setup. Firstly, we extend the case of scenarios in which reconstruction is plausible while reducing the minimal re- quirements for a unique reconstruction. This happens as a consequence of the fact that radiometric cues add an additional known variable to the already existing system of equations. Secondly, we present a simple algorithm for reconstruction, owing to the nature of the radiometric cue. We present several synthetic experiments to validate our theories, and show high quality reconstructions in challenging scenarios.</p><p>5 0.24060975 <a title="400-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Mirror_Surface_Reconstruction_from_a_Single_Image.html">286 cvpr-2013-Mirror Surface Reconstruction from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Miaomiao Liu, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of reconstructing the shape of a smooth mirror surface from a single image. In particular, we consider the case where the camera is observing the reflection of a static reference target in the unknown mirror. We first study the reconstruction problem given dense correspondences between 3D points on the reference target and image locations. In such conditions, our differential geometry analysis provides a theoretical proof that the shape of the mirror surface can be uniquely recovered if the pose of the reference target is known. We then relax our assumptions by considering the case where only sparse correspondences are available. In this scenario, we formulate reconstruction as an optimization problem, which can be solved using a nonlinear least-squares method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real images.</p><p>6 0.19559388 <a title="400-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Discovering_the_Structure_of_a_Planar_Mirror_System_from_Multiple_Observations_of_a_Single_Point.html">127 cvpr-2013-Discovering the Structure of a Planar Mirror System from Multiple Observations of a Single Point</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Ji, Jinwei Ye, Jingyi Yu</p><p>Abstract: Transparent gas flows are difficult to reconstruct: the refractive index field (RIF) within the gas volume is uneven and rapidly evolving, and correspondence matching under distortions is challenging. We present a novel computational imaging solution by exploiting the light field probe (LFProbe). A LF-probe resembles a view-dependent pattern where each pixel on the pattern maps to a unique ray. By . ude l. edu observing the LF-probe through the gas flow, we acquire a dense set of ray-ray correspondences and then reconstruct their light paths. To recover the RIF, we use Fermat’s Principle to correlate each light path with the RIF via a Partial Differential Equation (PDE). We then develop an iterative optimization scheme to solve for all light-path PDEs in conjunction. Specifically, we initialize the light paths by fitting Hermite splines to ray-ray correspondences, discretize their PDEs onto voxels, and solve a large, over-determined PDE system for the RIF. The RIF can then be used to refine the light paths. Finally, we alternate the RIF and light-path estimations to improve the reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our approach can reliably reconstruct small to medium scale gas flows. In particular, when the flow is acquired by a small number of cameras, the use of ray-ray correspondences can greatly improve the reconstruction.</p><p>6 0.73332328 <a title="400-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Principal_Observation_Ray_Calibration_for_Tiled-Lens-Array_Integral_Imaging_Display.html">337 cvpr-2013-Principal Observation Ray Calibration for Tiled-Lens-Array Integral Imaging Display</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Agrawal, Srikumar Ramalingam</p><p>Abstract: Imaging systems consisting of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) have been used for wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2D calibration grid. The pose of the calibration grid is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the calibration grid can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6-DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm.</p><p>2 0.85031646 <a title="400-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Determining_Motion_Directly_from_Normal_Flows_Upon_the_Use_of_a_Spherical_Eye_Platform.html">124 cvpr-2013-Determining Motion Directly from Normal Flows Upon the Use of a Spherical Eye Platform</a></p>
<p>Author: Tak-Wai Hui, Ronald Chung</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of recovering camera motion from video data, which does not require the establishment of feature correspondences or computation of optical flows but from normal flows directly. We have designed an imaging system that has a wide field of view by fixating a number of cameras together to form an approximate spherical eye. With a substantially widened visual field, we discover that estimating the directions of translation and rotation components of the motion separately are possible and particularly efficient. In addition, the inherent ambiguities between translation and rotation also disappear. Magnitude of rotation is recovered subsequently. Experimental results on synthetic and real image data are provided. The results show that not only the accuracy of motion estimation is comparable to those of the state-of-the-art methods that require explicit feature correspondences or optical flows, but also a faster computation time.</p><p>3 0.84740484 <a title="400-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Information_Consensus_for_Distributed_Multi-target_Tracking.html">224 cvpr-2013-Information Consensus for Distributed Multi-target Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed T. Kamal, Jay A. Farrell, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: Due to their high fault-tolerance, ease of installation and scalability to large networks, distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity in the sensor networks community, especially in computer vision. Multitarget tracking in a camera network is one of the fundamental problems in this domain. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors. Since most cameras are directional sensors, it is often the case that neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same target. Such sensors that do not have information about a target are termed as “naive ” with respect to that target. In this paper, we propose consensus-based distributed multi-target tracking algorithms in a camera network that are designed to address this issue of naivety. The estimation errors in tracking and data association, as well as the effect of naivety, are jointly addressed leading to the development of an informationweighted consensus algorithm, which we term as the Multitarget Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm. The incorporation of the probabilistic data association mecha- nism makes the MTIC algorithm very robust to false measurements/clutter. Experimental analysis is provided to support the theoretical results.</p><p>4 0.84096438 <a title="400-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Can_a_Fully_Unconstrained_Imaging_Model_Be_Applied_Effectively_to_Central_Cameras%3F.html">76 cvpr-2013-Can a Fully Unconstrained Imaging Model Be Applied Effectively to Central Cameras?</a></p>
<p>Author: Filippo Bergamasco, Andrea Albarelli, Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello</p><p>Abstract: Traditional camera models are often the result of a compromise between the ability to account for non-linearities in the image formation model and the need for a feasible number of degrees of freedom in the estimation process. These considerations led to the definition of several ad hoc models that best adapt to different imaging devices, ranging from pinhole cameras with no radial distortion to the more complex catadioptric or polydioptric optics. In this paper we dai s .unive . it ence points in the scene with their projections on the image plane [5]. Unfortunately, no real camera behaves exactly like an ideal pinhole. In fact, in most cases, at least the distortion effects introduced by the lens should be accounted for [19]. Any pinhole-based model, regardless of its level of sophistication, is geometrically unable to properly describe cameras exhibiting a frustum angle that is near or above 180 degrees. For wide-angle cameras, several different para- metric models have been proposed. Some of them try to modify the captured image in order to follow the original propose the use of an unconstrained model even in standard central camera settings dominated by the pinhole model, and introduce a novel calibration approach that can deal effectively with the huge number of free parameters associated with it, resulting in a higher precision calibration than what is possible with the standard pinhole model with correction for radial distortion. This effectively extends the use of general models to settings that traditionally have been ruled by parametric approaches out of practical considerations. The benefit of such an unconstrained model to quasipinhole central cameras is supported by an extensive experimental validation.</p><p>5 0.82656091 <a title="400-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Brain_Effective_Connectivity_Analysis_for_Alzheimer%27s_Disease%3A_A_Kernel_Learning_Approach_upon_Sparse_Gaussian_Bayesian_Network.html">129 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Brain Effective Connectivity Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease: A Kernel Learning Approach upon Sparse Gaussian Bayesian Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Luping Zhou, Lei Wang, Lingqiao Liu, Philip Ogunbona, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Analyzing brain networks from neuroimages is becoming a promising approach in identifying novel connectivitybased biomarkers for the Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this regard, brain “effective connectivity ” analysis, which studies the causal relationship among brain regions, is highly challenging and of many research opportunities. Most of the existing works in this field use generative methods. Despite their success in data representation and other important merits, generative methods are not necessarily discriminative, which may cause the ignorance of subtle but critical disease-induced changes. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that integrates the benefits of generative and discriminative methods to recover effective connectivity. In particular, we employ Fisher kernel to bridge the generative models of sparse Bayesian networks (SBN) and the discriminative classifiers of SVMs, and convert the SBN parameter learning to Fisher kernel learning via minimizing a generalization error bound of SVMs. Our method is able to simultaneously boost the discriminative power of both the generative SBN models and the SBN-induced SVM classifiers via Fisher kernel. The proposed method is tested on analyzing brain effective connectivity for AD from ADNI data, and demonstrates significant improvements over the state-of-the-art work.</p><p>6 0.81771201 <a title="400-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Adaptive_Active_Learning_for_Image_Classification.html">34 cvpr-2013-Adaptive Active Learning for Image Classification</a></p>
