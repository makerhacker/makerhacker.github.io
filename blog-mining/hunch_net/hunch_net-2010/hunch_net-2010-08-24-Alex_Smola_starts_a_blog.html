<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

<p>Introduction: I want to expand onthis postwhich describes one of the core tricks for
makingVowpal Wabbitfast and easy to use when learning from text.The central
trick is converting a word (or any other parseable quantity) into a number via
a hash function.Kishoretells me this is a relatively old trick in NLP land,
but it has some added advantages when doing online learning, because you can
learn directly from the existing data without preprocessing the data to create
features (destroying the online property) or using an expensive hashtable
lookup (slowing things down).A central concern for this approach is
collisions, which create a loss of information. If you usemfeatures in an
index space of sizenthe birthday paradox suggests a collision ifm > n0.5,
essentially because there arem2pairs. This is pretty bad, because it says that
with a vocabulary of105features, you might need to have1010entries in your
table.It turns out that redundancy is great for dealing with
collisions.Alexand I worked out a cou</p><p>4 0.071977437 <a title="408-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for
all sorts of tasks where it either wasn't previously collected, or for tasks
that did not previously exist. While this is great for Machine Learning, it
has a downside--the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead
to substantial privacy problems.It's important to understand that this is a
much harder problem than many people appreciate. TheAOLdatareleaseis a good
example. To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be
obvious:Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable
information. The logic here seems to be "if I can't easily find the person
then no one can". That doesn't work as demonstrated by the people who were
found circumstantially from the AOL data.… then just hash all the search
terms! The logic here is "if I can't read it, then no one can". It's also
trivially broken by a dictionary attack--just hash all the strings that might
be in the data an</p><p>5 0.069553971 <a title="408-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-07-Is_the_Google_way_the_way_for_machine_learning%3F.html">136 hunch net-2005-12-07-Is the Google way the way for machine learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs HoelzlefromGooglegave an invited presentation atNIPS. In the presentation,
he strongly advocates interacting with data in a particular scalable manner
which is something like the following:Make a cluster of machines.Build a
unified filesystem. (Google uses GFS, but NFS or other approaches work
reasonably well for smaller clusters.)Interact with data viaMapReduce.Creating
a cluster of machines is, by this point, relatively straightforward.Unified
filesystems are a little bit tricky--GFS is capable by design of essentially
unlimited speed throughput to disk. NFS can bottleneck because all of the data
has to move through one machine. Nevertheless, this may not be a limiting
factor for smaller clusters.MapReduce is a programming paradigm. Essentially,
it is a combination of a data element transform (map) and an
agreggator/selector (reduce). These operations are highly parallelizable and
the claim is that they support the forms of data interaction which are
necessary.Apparently, theNutc</p><p>6 0.06747523 <a title="408-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been looking at some recent embeddings work, and am struck by how
beautiful the theory and algorithms are. It also makes me wonder, what are
embeddings good for?A few things immediately come to mind:(1) For
visualization of high-dimensional data sets.In this case, one would like good
algorithms for embedding specifically into 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean
spaces.(2) For nonparametric modeling.The usual nonparametric models
(histograms, nearest neighbor) often require resources which are exponential
in the dimension. So if the data actually lie close to some low-
dimensionalsurface, it might be a good idea to first identify this surface and
embed the data before applying the model.Incidentally, for applications like
these, it's important to have a functional mapping from high to low dimension,
which some techniques do not yield up.(3) As a prelude to classifier
learning.The hope here is presumably that learning will be easier in the low-
dimensional space, because of (i) better ge</p><p>5 0.5777396 <a title="408-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>6 0.56616688 <a title="408-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-18-It%26%238217%3Bs_MDL_Jim%2C_but_not_as_we_know_it%26%238230%3B%28on_Bayes%2C_MDL_and_consistency%29.html">263 hunch net-2007-09-18-It&#8217;s MDL Jim, but not as we know it&#8230;(on Bayes, MDL and consistency)</a></p>

driving. It was run once in 2004 for the first time and all teams did badly.
This year was notably different with theStanfordandCMUteams succesfully

coverage.A formal winner hasn't been declared yet although Stanford completed
the course quickest.The Stanford and CMU teams deserve a large round of
applause as they have strongly demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous
