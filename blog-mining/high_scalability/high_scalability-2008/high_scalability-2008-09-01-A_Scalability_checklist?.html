haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what
technologies would you use?Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high
in the running. But would you tack on CakePHP? Drupal? or build your
framework/CMS from scratch?What version of Linux runs best for a scalable
website?Would you consider Windows and .NET? Java? Or do you want to throw a
brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?Would you prefer Postgres,
Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why
not?Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument. I am pretty
versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose. So all
skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest
development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.Let's say,
for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back
& forth as an eBay.Definitely building this on a budget..Jason</p><p>6 0.6946342 <a title="375-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-S3_for_image_storing.html">199 high scalability-2008-01-01-S3 for image storing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are
using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it
has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've
only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster,
and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will
take even longer the more files we get.What worries me is that it seems to
make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and
soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node.
It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include
the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling
strategy.We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1
as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the
DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files are

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ'sBig Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature
Scalaculation?twines several different threads on the topic together into a
fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard
to sell scalabilityso just forget it.The premise ofStartups and The Problem Of
Premature ScalaculationandDonâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Martis that
you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since
2005.Thanks to many books a</p><p>5 0.62175286 <a title="375-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution_of_queries_per_second.html">622 high scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution of queries per second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity
planning purposes.Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak
QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though,
where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's
ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really
like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS.
Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the
busiest seconds during the day.My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs
do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the
95th percentile.What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries
executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to
the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that steeply
declines and flattens out near zero.Does anyone know if there is a
