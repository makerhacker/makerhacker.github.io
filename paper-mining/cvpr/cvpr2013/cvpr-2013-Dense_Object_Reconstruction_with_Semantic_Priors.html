<p>Author: Nan Hu, Raif M. Rustamov, Leonidas Guibas</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the weighted graph matching problem with partially disclosed correspondences between a number of anchor nodes. Our construction exploits recently introduced node signatures based on graph Laplacians, namely the Laplacian family signature (LFS) on the nodes, and the pairwise heat kernel map on the edges. In this paper, without assuming an explicit form of parametric dependence nor a distance metric between node signatures, we formulate an optimization problem which incorporates the knowledge of anchor nodes. Solving this problem gives us an optimized proximity measure specific to the graphs under consideration. Using this as a first order compatibility term, we then set up an integer quadratic program (IQP) to solve for a near optimal graph matching. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on randomly generated graphs and on two widelyused image sequences, when compared with other existing signature and adjacency matrix based graph matching methods.</p><p>3 0.21556906 <a title="110-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_Changes_in_3D_Structure_of_a_Scene_from_Multi-view_Images_Captured_by_a_Vehicle-Mounted_Camera.html">117 cvpr-2013-Detecting Changes in 3D Structure of a Scene from Multi-view Images Captured by a Vehicle-Mounted Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Ken Sakurada, Takayuki Okatani, Koichiro Deguchi</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method for detecting temporal changes of the three-dimensional structure of an outdoor scene from its multi-view images captured at two separate times. For the images, we consider those captured by a camera mounted on a vehicle running in a city street. The method estimates scene structures probabilistically, not deterministically, and based on their estimates, it evaluates the probability of structural changes in the scene, where the inputs are the similarity of the local image patches among the multi-view images. The aim of the probabilistic treatment is to maximize the accuracy of change detection, behind which there is our conjecture that although it is difficult to estimate the scene structures deterministically, it should be easier to detect their changes. The proposed method is compared with the methods that use multi-view stereo (MVS) to reconstruct the scene structures of the two time points and then differentiate them to detect changes. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms such MVS-based methods.</p><p>4 0.14488496 <a title="110-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Compressed_Hashing.html">87 cvpr-2013-Compressed Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yue Lin, Rong Jin, Deng Cai, Shuicheng Yan, Xuelong Li</p><p>Abstract: Recent studies have shown that hashing methods are effective for high dimensional nearest neighbor search. A common problem shared by many existing hashing methods is that in order to achieve a satisfied performance, a large number of hash tables (i.e., long codewords) are required. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel approach called Compressed Hashing by exploring the techniques of sparse coding and compressed sensing. In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>5 0.14458252 <a title="110-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible_Image_Stitching_with_Moving_DLT.html">47 cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT</a></p>
<p>Author: Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Michael S. Brown, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, i.e., when the underpinning assumptions oftheprojective model are not fully satisfied by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp — a model that is justified when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we propose as-projective-as-possible warps, i.e., warps that aim to be globally projective, yet allow local non-projective deviations to account for violations to the assumed imaging conditions. Based on a novel estimation technique called Moving Direct Linear Transformation (Moving DLT), our method seamlessly bridges image regions that are inconsistent with the projective model. The result is highly accurate image stitching, with significantly reduced ghosting effects, thus lowering the dependency on post hoc deghosting.</p><p>6 0.12249149 <a title="110-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less_Non-rigid_Registration_of_Triangular_Surface_Meshes.html">97 cvpr-2013-Correspondence-Less Non-rigid Registration of Triangular Surface Meshes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ming Zeng, Jiaxiang Zheng, Xuan Cheng, Xinguo Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a method for quasi-rigid objects modeling from a sequence of depth scans captured at different time instances. As quasi-rigid objects, such as human bodies, usually have shape motions during the capture procedure, it is difficult to reconstruct their geometries. We represent the shape motion by a deformation graph, and propose a model-to-partmethod to gradually integrate sampled points of depth scans into the deformation graph. Under an as-rigid-as-possible assumption, the model-to-part method can adjust the deformation graph non-rigidly, so as to avoid error accumulation in alignment, which also implicitly achieves loop-closure. To handle the drift and topological error for the deformation graph, two algorithms are introduced. First, we use a two-stage registration to largely keep the rigid motion part. Second, in the step of graph integration, we topology-adaptively integrate new parts and dynamically control the regularization effect of the deformation graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by several depth sequences of quasi-rigid objects, and an application in human shape modeling.</p><p>3 0.69076633 <a title="110-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible_Image_Stitching_with_Moving_DLT.html">47 cvpr-2013-As-Projective-As-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT</a></p>

<p>Author: Ravi Garg, Anastasios Roussos, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: This paper offers the first variational approach to the problem of dense 3D reconstruction of non-rigid surfaces from a monocular video sequence. We formulate nonrigid structure from motion (NRSfM) as a global variational energy minimization problem to estimate dense low-rank smooth 3D shapes for every frame along with the camera motion matrices, given dense 2D correspondences. Unlike traditional factorization based approaches to NRSfM, which model the low-rank non-rigid shape using a fixed number of basis shapes and corresponding coefficients, we minimize the rank of the matrix of time-varying shapes directly via trace norm minimization. In conjunction with this low-rank constraint, we use an edge preserving total-variation regularization term to obtain spatially smooth shapes for every frame. Thanks to proximal splitting techniques the optimization problem can be decomposed into many point-wise sub-problems and simple linear systems which can be easily solved on GPU hardware. We show results on real sequences of different objects (face, torso, beating heart) where, despite challenges in tracking, illumination changes and occlusions, our method reconstructs highly deforming smooth surfaces densely and accurately directly from video, without the need for any prior models or shape templates.</p><p>5 0.59916735 <a title="110-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Lili Tao, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach based on a non-linear manifold learning technique is proposed to recover 3D nonrigid structures from 2D image sequences captured by a single camera. Most ofthe existing approaches assume that 3D shapes can be accurately modelled in a linear subspace. These techniques perform well when the deformations are relatively small or simple, but fail when more complex deformations need to be recovered. The non-linear deformations are often observed in highly flexible objects for which the use of the linear model is impractical. A specific type of shape variations might be governed by only a small number of parameters, therefore can be wellrepresented in a low dimensional manifold. We learn a nonlinear shape prior using diffusion maps method. The key contribution in this paper is the introduction of the shape prior that constrain the reconstructed shapes to lie in the learned manifold. The proposed methodology has been validated quantitatively and qualitatively on 2D points sequences projected from the 3D motion capture data and real 2D video sequences. The comparisons oftheproposed man- ifold based method against several state-of-the-art techniques are shown on different types of deformable objects.</p><p>6 0.59911078 <a title="110-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Estimation_of_Nonrigid_Transformation_for_Point_Set_Registration.html">360 cvpr-2013-Robust Estimation of Nonrigid Transformation for Point Set Registration</a></p>

In particular, we introduce a sparse coding scheme, based on the approximation theory of integral operator, that generate sparse representation for high dimensional vectors. We then project sparse codes into a low dimensional space by effectively exploring the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), a key property in compressed sensing theory. Both of the theoretical analysis and the empirical studies on two large data sets show that the proposed approach is more effective than the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80648005 <a title="110-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Dense_Object_Reconstruction_with_Semantic_Priors.html">110 cvpr-2013-Dense Object Reconstruction with Semantic Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Sid Yingze Bao, Manmohan Chandraker, Yuanqing Lin, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: We present a dense reconstruction approach that overcomes the drawbacks of traditional multiview stereo by incorporating semantic information in the form of learned category-level shape priors and object detection. Given training data comprised of 3D scans and images of objects from various viewpoints, we learn a prior comprised of a mean shape and a set of weighted anchor points. The former captures the commonality of shapes across the category, while the latter encodes similarities between instances in the form of appearance and spatial consistency. We propose robust algorithms to match anchor points across instances that enable learning a mean shape for the category, even with large shape variations across instances. We model the shape of an object instance as a warped version of the category mean, along with instance-specific details. Given multiple images of an unseen instance, we collate information from 2D object detectors to align the structure from motion point cloud with the mean shape, which is subsequently warped and refined to approach the actual shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model is general enough to learn semantic priors for different object categories, yet powerful enough to reconstruct individual shapes with large variations. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our framework can produce more accurate reconstructions than alternative state-of-the-art multiview stereo systems.</p><p>3 0.76742035 <a title="110-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Binary_Code_Ranking_with_Weighted_Hamming_Distance.html">63 cvpr-2013-Binary Code Ranking with Weighted Hamming Distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Jinhu Tang, Ke Lu, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Binary hashing has been widely used for efficient similarity search due to its query and storage efficiency. In most existing binary hashing methods, the high-dimensional data are embedded into Hamming space and the distance or similarity of two points are approximated by the Hamming distance between their binary codes. The Hamming distance calculation is efficient, however, in practice, there are often lots of results sharing the same Hamming distance to a query, which makes this distance measure ambiguous and poses a critical issue for similarity search where ranking is important. In this paper, we propose a weighted Hamming distance ranking algorithm (WhRank) to rank the binary codes of hashing methods. By assigning different bit-level weights to different hash bits, the returned binary codes are ranked at a finer-grained binary code level. We give an algorithm to learn the data-adaptive and query-sensitive weight for each hash bit. Evaluations on two large-scale image data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our weighted Hamming distance for binary code ranking.</p><p>4 0.74428946 <a title="110-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Motion_Estimation_for_Self-Driving_Cars_with_a_Generalized_Camera.html">290 cvpr-2013-Motion Estimation for Self-Driving Cars with a Generalized Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Gim Hee Lee, Friedrich Faundorfer, Marc Pollefeys</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a visual ego-motion estimation algorithm for a self-driving car equipped with a closeto-market multi-camera system. By modeling the multicamera system as a generalized camera and applying the non-holonomic motion constraint of a car, we show that this leads to a novel 2-point minimal solution for the generalized essential matrix where the full relative motion including metric scale can be obtained. We provide the analytical solutions for the general case with at least one inter-camera correspondence and a special case with only intra-camera correspondences. We show that up to a maximum of 6 solutions exist for both cases. We identify the existence of degeneracy when the car undergoes straight motion in the special case with only intra-camera correspondences where the scale becomes unobservable and provide a practical alternative solution. Our formulation can be efficiently implemented within RANSAC for robust estimation. We verify the validity of our assumptions on the motion model by comparing our results on a large real-world dataset collected by a car equipped with 4 cameras with minimal overlapping field-of-views against the GPS/INS ground truth.</p><p>5 0.74301547 <a title="110-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Optical_Flow_Estimation_Using_Laplacian_Mesh_Energy.html">316 cvpr-2013-Optical Flow Estimation Using Laplacian Mesh Energy</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Li, Darren Cosker, Matthew Brown, Rui Tang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel non-rigid optical flow algorithm for dense image correspondence and non-rigid registration. The algorithm uses a unique Laplacian Mesh Energy term to encourage local smoothness whilst simultaneously preserving non-rigid deformation. Laplacian deformation approaches have become popular in graphics research as they enable mesh deformations to preserve local surface shape. In this work we propose a novel Laplacian Mesh Energy formula to ensure such sensible local deformations between image pairs. We express this wholly within the optical flow optimization, and show its application in a novel coarse-to-fine pyramidal approach. Our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in all trials on the Garg et al. dataset, and top tier performance on the Middlebury evaluation.</p><p>6 0.7427544 <a title="110-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Axially_Symmetric_3D_Pots_Configuration_System_Using_Axis_of_Symmetry_and_Break_Curve.html">52 cvpr-2013-Axially Symmetric 3D Pots Configuration System Using Axis of Symmetry and Break Curve</a></p>
