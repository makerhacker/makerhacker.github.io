<p>Author: Yoshihide Kato ; Shigeki Matsubara</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a method of correcting annotation errors in a treebank. By using a synchronous grammar, the method transforms parse trees containing annotation errors into the ones whose errors are corrected. The synchronous grammar is automatically induced from the treebank. We report an experimental result of applying our method to the Penn Treebank. The result demonstrates that our method corrects syntactic annotation errors with high precision.</p><p>3 0.28283912 <a title="46-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Blocked_Inference_in_Bayesian_Tree_Substitution_Grammars.html">53 acl-2010-Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Learning a tree substitution grammar is very challenging due to derivational ambiguity. Our recent approach used a Bayesian non-parametric model to induce good derivations from treebanked input (Cohn et al., 2009), biasing towards small grammars composed of small generalisable productions. In this paper we present a novel training method for the model using a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sampler in place of the previous method’s local Gibbs sampler. The blocked sampler makes considerably larger moves than the local sampler and consequently con- verges in less time. A core component of the algorithm is a grammar transformation which represents an infinite tree substitution grammar in a finite context free grammar. This enables efficient blocked inference for training and also improves the parsing algorithm. Both algorithms are shown to improve parsing accuracy.</p><p>4 0.25856712 <a title="46-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-Learning_to_Translate_with_Source_and_Target_Syntax.html">169 acl-2010-Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Statistical translation models that try to capture the recursive structure of language have been widely adopted over the last few years. These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory: some use none at all, some use information about the grammar of the target language, some use information about the grammar of the source language. But progress has been slower on translation models that are able to learn the relationship between the grammars of both the source and target language. We discuss the reasons why this has been a challenge, review existing attempts to meet this challenge, and show how some old and new ideas can be combined into a sim- ple approach that uses both source and target syntax for significant improvements in translation accuracy.</p><p>5 0.24474427 <a title="46-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Tree_Transducer_Model_for_Synchronous_Tree-Adjoining_Grammars.html">21 acl-2010-A Tree Transducer Model for Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Grammars</a></p>

This characterization allows the easy integration of STAG into toolkits for extended tree transducers.

<p>Author: Tong Xiao ; Jingbo Zhu ; Muhua Zhu ; Huizhen Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple and effective method to address the issue of how to generate diversified translation systems from a single Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) engine for system combination. Our method is based on the framework of boosting. First, a sequence of weak translation systems is generated from a baseline system in an iterative manner. Then, a strong translation system is built from the ensemble of these weak translation systems. To adapt boosting to SMT system combination, several key components of the original boosting algorithms are redesigned in this work. We evaluate our method on Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) tasks in three baseline systems, including a phrase-based system, a hierarchical phrasebased system and a syntax-based system. The experimental results on three NIST evaluation test sets show that our method leads to significant improvements in translation accuracy over the baseline systems. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81574923 <a title="46-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Bayesian_Synchronous_Tree-Substitution_Grammar_Induction_and_Its_Application_to_Sentence_Compression.html">46 acl-2010-Bayesian Synchronous Tree-Substitution Grammar Induction and Its Application to Sentence Compression</a></p>

<p>Author: Fei Wu ; Daniel S. Weld</p><p>Abstract: Information-extraction (IE) systems seek to distill semantic relations from naturallanguage text, but most systems use supervised learning of relation-specific examples and are thus limited by the availability of training data. Open IE systems such as TextRunner, on the other hand, aim to handle the unbounded number of relations found on the Web. But how well can these open systems perform? This paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner’s precision and recall. The key to WOE’s performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors using heuris— tic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE’s extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher.</p><p>4 0.76183397 <a title="46-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-An_Open-Source_Package_for_Recognizing_Textual_Entailment.html">30 acl-2010-An Open-Source Package for Recognizing Textual Entailment</a></p>

The system implements a collection of algorithms, providing a configurable framework to quickly set up a working environment to experiment with the RTE task. Fast prototyping of new solutions is also allowed by the possibility to extend its modular architecture.

<p>Author: Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Tree-to-string systems (and their forestbased extensions) have gained steady popularity thanks to their simplicity and efficiency, but there is a major limitation: they are unable to guarantee the grammaticality of the output, which is explicitly modeled in string-to-tree systems via targetside syntax. We thus propose to combine the advantages of both, and present a novel constituency-to-dependency translation model, which uses constituency forests on the source side to direct the translation, and dependency trees on the target side (as a language model) to ensure grammaticality. Medium-scale experiments show an absolute and statistically significant improvement of +0.7 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art forest-based tree-to-string system even with fewer rules. This is also the first time that a treeto-tree model can surpass tree-to-string counterparts.</p><p>6 0.69398034 <a title="46-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Filtering_Syntactic_Constraints_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">115 acl-2010-Filtering Syntactic Constraints for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
