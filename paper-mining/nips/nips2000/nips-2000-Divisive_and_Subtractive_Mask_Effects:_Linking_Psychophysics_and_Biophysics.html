<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analysis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some degenerate cases. In a broader context, the network serves as a particular illustration of the general distinction between permitted and forbidden sets, which was introduced recently. From this viewpoint, the computational function of our network is to store and retrieve memories as permitted sets of coactive neurons. In traditional winner-take-all networks, lateral inhibition is used to enforce a localized, or</p><p>4 0.13015941 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Place_Cells_and_Spatial_Navigation_Based_on_2D_Visual_Feature_Extraction%2C_Path_Integration%2C_and_Reinforcement_Learning.html">101 nips-2000-Place Cells and Spatial Navigation Based on 2D Visual Feature Extraction, Path Integration, and Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We explore the statistical properties of natural sound stimuli preprocessed with a bank of linear filters. The responses of such filters exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in which the response variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned for nearby frequencies. These dependencies may be substantially reduced using an operation known as divisive normalization, in which the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of the rectified responses of other filters. The weights may be chosen to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for an ensemble of natural sounds. We demonstrate that the resulting model accounts for nonlinearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by comparing model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous work (NIPS, 1998) we demonstrated that an analogous model derived from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Thus, divisive normalization appears to be a generic mechanism for eliminating a type of statistical dependency that is prevalent in natural signals of different modalities. Signals in the real world are highly structured. For example, natural sounds typically contain both harmonic and rythmic structure. It is reasonable to assume that biological auditory systems are designed to represent these structures in an efficient manner [e.g., 1,2]. Specifically, Barlow hypothesized that a role of early sensory processing is to remove redundancy in the sensory input, resulting in a set of neural responses that are statistically independent. Experimentally, one can test this hypothesis by examining the statistical properties of neural responses under natural stimulation conditions [e.g., 3,4], or the statistical dependency of pairs (or groups) of neural responses. Due to their technical difficulty, such multi-cellular experiments are only recently becoming possible, and the earliest reports in vision appear consistent with the hypothesis [e.g., 5]. An alternative approach, which we follow here, is to develop a neural model from the statistics of natural signals and show that response properties of this model are similar to those of biological sensory neurons. A number of researchers have derived linear filter models using statistical criterion. For visual images, this results in linear filters localized in frequency, orientation and phase [6, 7]. Similar work in audition has yielded filters localized in frequency and phase [8]. Although these linear models provide an important starting point for neural modeling, sensory neurons are highly nonlinear. In addition, the statistical properties of natural signals are too complex to expect a linear transformation to result in an independent set of components. Recent results indicate that nonlinear gain control plays an important role in neural processing. Ruderman and Bialek [9] have shown that division by a local estimate of standard deviation can increase the entropy of responses of center-surround filters to natural images. Such a model is consistent with the properties of neurons in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. Heeger and colleagues have shown that the nonlinear behaviors of neurons in primary visual cortex may be described using a form of gain control known as divisive normalization [10], in which the response of a linear kernel is rectified and divided by the sum of other rectified kernel responses and a constant. We have recently shown that the responses of oriented linear filters exhibit nonlinear statistical dependencies that may be substantially reduced using a variant of this model, in which the normalization signal is computed from a weighted sum of other rectified kernel responses [11, 12]. The resulting model, with weighting parameters determined from image statistics, accounts qualitatively for physiological nonlinearities observed in primary visual cortex. In this paper, we demonstrate that the responses of bandpass linear filters to natural sounds exhibit striking statistical dependencies, analogous to those found in visual images. A divisive normalization procedure can substantially remove these dependencies. We show that this model, with parameters optimized for a collection of natural sounds, can account for nonlinear behaviors of neurons at the level of the auditory nerve. Specifically, we show that: 1) the shape offrequency tuning curves varies with sound pressure level, even though the underlying linear filters are fixed; and 2) superposition of a non-optimal tone suppresses the response of a linear filter in a divisive fashion, and the amount of suppression depends on the distance between the frequency of the tone and the preferred frequency of the filter. 1 Empirical observations of natural sound statistics The basic statistical properties of natural sounds, as observed through a linear filter, have been previously documented by Attias [13]. In particular, he showed that, as with visual images, the spectral energy falls roughly according to a power law, and that the histograms of filter responses are more kurtotic than a Gaussian (i.e., they have a sharp peak at zero, and very long tails). Here we examine the joint statistical properties of a pair of linear filters tuned for nearby temporal frequencies. We choose a fixed set of filters that have been widely used in modeling the peripheral auditory system [14]. Figure 1 shows joint histograms of the instantaneous responses of a particular pair of linear filters to five different types of natural sound, and white noise. First note that the responses are approximately decorrelated: the expected value of the y-axis value is roughly zero for all values of the x-axis variable. The responses are not, however, statistically independent: the width of the distribution of responses of one filter increases with the response amplitude of the other filter. If the two responses were statistically independent, then the response of the first filter should not provide any information about the distribution of responses of the other filter. We have found that this type of variance dependency (sometimes accompanied by linear correlation) occurs in a wide range of natural sounds, ranging from animal sounds to music. We emphasize that this dependency is a property of natural sounds, and is not due purely to our choice of linear filters. For example, no such dependency is observed when the input consists of white noise (see Fig. 1). The strength of this dependency varies for different pairs of linear filters . In addition, we see this type of dependency between instantaneous responses of a single filter at two Speech o -1 Drums • Monkey Cat White noise Nocturnal nature I~ ~; ~ • Figure 1: Joint conditional histogram of instantaneous linear responses of two bandpass filters with center frequencies 2000 and 2840 Hz. Pixel intensity corresponds to frequency of occurrence of a given pair of values, except that each column has been independently rescaled to fill the full intensity range. For the natural sounds, responses are not independent: the standard deviation of the ordinate is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the abscissa. Natural sounds were recorded from CDs and converted to sampling frequency of 22050 Hz. nearby time instants. Since the dependency involves the variance of the responses, we can substantially reduce it by dividing. In particular, the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of responses of other rectified filters and an additive constant. Specifically: L2 Ri = 2: (1) 12 j WjiLj + 0'2 where Li is the instantaneous linear response of filter i, strength of suppression of filter i by filter j. 0' is a constant and Wji controls the We would like to choose the parameters of the model (the weights Wji, and the constant 0') to optimize the independence of the normalized response to an ensemble of natural sounds. Such an optimization is quite computationally expensive.

In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state.

<p>Author: Te-Won Lee, Thomas Wachtler, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by the three types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This color opponency has been shown to constitute an efficient encoding by spectral decorrelation of the receptor signals. We analyze the spatial and chromatic structure of natural scenes by decomposing the spectral images into a set of linear basis functions such that they constitute a representation with minimal redundancy. Independent component analysis finds the basis functions that transforms the spatiochromatic data such that the outputs (activations) are statistically as independent as possible, i.e. least redundant. The resulting basis functions show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges), along a blueyellow direction, and along a red-blue direction. Furthermore, the resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that the use of color opponency in the human visual system achieves a highly efficient representation of colors. Our findings suggest that color opponency is a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the overlapping cone spectral sensitivities. 1 Statistical structure of natural scenes Efficient encoding of visual sensory information is an important task for information processing systems and its study may provide insights into coding principles of biological visual systems.

<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

<p>Author: Mark A. Smith, Garrison W. Cottrell, Karen L. Anderson</p><p>Abstract: The strong correlation between the frequency of words and their naming latency has been well documented. However, as early as 1973, the Age of Acquisition (AoA) of a word was alleged to be the actual variable of interest, but these studies seem to have been ignored in most of the literature. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in AoA. While some studies have shown that frequency has no effect when AoA is controlled for, more recent studies have found independent contributions of frequency and AoA. Connectionist models have repeatedly shown strong effects of frequency, but little attention has been paid to whether they can also show AoA effects. Indeed, several researchers have explicitly claimed that they cannot show AoA effects. In this work, we explore these claims using a simple feed forward neural network. We find a significant contribution of AoA to naming latency, as well as conditions under which frequency provides an independent contribution. 1 Background Naming latency is the time between the presentation of a picture or written word and the beginning of the correct utterance of that word. It is undisputed that there are significant differences in the naming latency of many words, even when controlling word length, syllabic complexity, and other structural variants. The cause of differences in naming latency has been the subject of numerous studies. Earlier studies found that the frequency with which a word appears in spoken English is the best determinant of its naming latency (Oldfield & Wingfield, 1965). More recent psychological studies, however, show that the age at which a word is learned, or its Age of Acquisition (AoA), may be a better predictor of naming latency. Further, in many multiple regression analyses, frequency is not found to be significant when AoA is controlled for (Brown & Watson, 1987; Carroll & White, 1973; Morrison et al. 1992; Morrison & Ellis, 1995). These studies show that frequency and AoA are highly correlated (typically r =-.6) explaining the confound of older studies on frequency. However, still more recent studies question this finding and find that both AoA and frequency are significant and contribute independently to naming latency (Ellis & Morrison, 1998; Gerhand & Barry, 1998,1999). Much like their psychological counterparts, connectionist networks also show very strong frequency effects. However, the ability of a connectionist network to show AoA effects has been doubted (Gerhand & Barry, 1998; Morrison & Ellis, 1995). Most of these claims are based on the well known fact that connectionist networks exhibit</p><p>3 0.51424479 <a title="42-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Sequentially_Fitting_%60%60Inclusive%27%27_Trees_for_Inference_in_Noisy-OR_Networks.html">115 nips-2000-Sequentially Fitting ``Inclusive'' Trees for Inference in Noisy-OR Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Relu Patrascu, Tommi Jaakkola, Jodi Moran</p><p>Abstract: An important class of problems can be cast as inference in noisyOR Bayesian networks, where the binary state of each variable is a logical OR of noisy versions of the states of the variable's parents. For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the symptom - on some occasions, a disease may fail to activate the symptom. Inference in richly-connected noisy-OR networks is intractable, but approximate methods (e .g., variational techniques) are showing increasing promise as practical solutions. One problem with most approximations is that they tend to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes in the true posterior, ignoring other plausible configurations of the hidden variables. We introduce a new sequential variational method for bipartite noisyOR networks, that favors including all modes of the true posterior and models the posterior distribution as a tree. We compare this method with other approximations using an ensemble of networks with network statistics that are comparable to the QMR-DT medical diagnostic network. 1 Inclusive variational approximations Approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference are gaining in popularity and are now even being incorporated into VLSI hardware (T. Richardson, personal communication). Approximate methods include variational techniques (Ghahramani and Jordan 1997; Saul et al. 1996; Frey and Hinton 1999; Jordan et al. 1999), local probability propagation (Gallager 1963; Pearl 1988; Frey 1998; MacKay 1999a; Freeman and Weiss 2001) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (Neal 1993; MacKay 1999b). Many algorithms have been proposed in each of these classes. One problem that most of the above algorithms suffer from is a tendency to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes of the target distribution (the distribution being approximated). In the case of medical diagnosis, different modes correspond to different explanations of the symptoms. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are usually guaranteed to eventually sample from all the modes, but this may take an extremely long time, even when tempered transitions (Neal 1996) are (a) ,,</p><p>4 0.40211523 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Dendritic_Compartmentalization_Could_Underlie_Competition_and_Attentional_Biasing_of_Simultaneous_Visual_Stimuli.html">40 nips-2000-Dendritic Compartmentalization Could Underlie Competition and Attentional Biasing of Simultaneous Visual Stimuli</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.</p><p>6 0.35979545 <a title="42-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Winner-take-all_Competition_Between_Groups_of_Neurons_in_Lateral_Inhibitory_Networks.html">81 nips-2000-Learning Winner-take-all Competition Between Groups of Neurons in Lateral Inhibitory Networks</a></p>
