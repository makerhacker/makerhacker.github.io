<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Behl, VP Ops @ LogicMonitor. Jeffhas been a bit
herder for the last 20 years, architecting and overseeing the infrastructure
for a number of SaaS based companies.  Data Replication for Disaster
RecoveryAn inevitable part of disaster recovery planning is making sure
customer data exists in multiple locations.  In the case of LogicMonitor, a
SaaS-based monitoring solution for physical, virtual, and cloud environments,
we wanted copies of customer data files both within a data center and outside
of it.  The former was to protect against the loss of individual servers
within a facility, and the latter for recovery in the event of the complete
loss of a data center.Where we were:  RsyncLike most everyone who starts off
in a Linux environment, we used our trusty friend rsync to copy data around.
Rsync is tried, true and tested, and works well when the number of servers,
the amount of data, and the number of files is not horrendous.  When any of
these are no longer</p><p>6 0.10458731 <a title="738-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Build_an_Infinitely_Scalable_Infrastructure_for_%24100_Using_Amazon_Services.html">38 high scalability-2007-07-30-Build an Infinitely Scalable Infrastructure for $100 Using Amazon Services</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced
with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa,
in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using
thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by
the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you?
Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with
redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster
leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the
ZooKeeper protocol.Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find
amessage queue in nearly every major architecture profile onHighScalability.
Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation
architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a
little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database
offloading, etc).</p><p>5 0.62156206 <a title="738-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-01-8_Commonly_Used_Scalable_System_Design_Patterns.html">951 high scalability-2010-12-01-8 Commonly Used Scalable System Design Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>2 0.90600139 <a title="738-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson_from_Airbnb%3A_Give_Yourself_Permission_to_Experiment_with_Non-scalable_Changes.html">1458 high scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson from Airbnb: Give Yourself Permission to Experiment with Non-scalable Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: Queuing work forprocessing in the backgroundis a time testedscalability
strategy. Queuing also happens to be one of those much needed tools where it
easy enough to forge for your own that we see a lot of different versions
made.Resque is GitHub'stake on a job queue and they've used it to process
million and millions of jobs so far.What is Resque?Redis-backedlibrary for
creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and
processing them later. Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that
responds to perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to
background jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you
can do both.GitHub tried and considered many other systems: SQS, Starling,
ActiveMessaging, BackgroundJob, DelayedJob, beanstalkd, AMQP,  and Kestrel,
but found them all wanting in one way are another. The latency for SQS was too
high. Others didn't make full use of Ruby. Others still had a lot of overhead.

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming
technology for playing video games o</p><p>5 0.73587382 <a title="738-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-16-7_Design_Patterns_for_Almost-infinite_Scalability.html">958 high scalability-2010-12-16-7 Design Patterns for Almost-infinite Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Good article frommanageability.com summarizing design patterns from Pat
Helland's amazing paperLife beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate's
Opinion.Entities are uniquely identified- each entity which represents
disjoint data (i.e. no overlap of data between entities) should have a unique
key.Multiple disjoint scopes of transactional serializability- in other words
there are these 'entities' and that you cannot perform atomic transactions
across these entities.At-Least-Once messaging- that is an application must
tolerate message retries and out-of-order arrival of messages.Messages are
adressed to entities- that is one can't abstract away from the business logic
the existence of the unique keys for addresing entities. Addressing however is
independent of location.Entities manage conversational state per party- that
is, to ensure idemptency an entity needs to remember that a message has been
previously processed. Furthermore, in a world without atomic transactions,
outcomes need t</p><p>6 0.71864623 <a title="738-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-07-Can_you_profit_from_the_coming_Content_Delivery_Network_wars%3F.html">60 high scalability-2007-08-07-Can you profit from the coming Content Delivery Network wars?</a></p>
