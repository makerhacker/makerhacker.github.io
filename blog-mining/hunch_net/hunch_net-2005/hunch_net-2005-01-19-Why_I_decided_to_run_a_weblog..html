<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>3 0.11516556 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-01-The_Webscience_Future.html">134 hunch net-2005-12-01-The Webscience Future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it's

known effects.Self-publishingBy default, all researchers in machine learning
(and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online
for anyone to download. The exact mechanism differs--physicists tend to use a
central repository (Arxiv) while computer scientists tend to place the papers
on their webpage. Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now
sometimes used by computer scientists.CollaborationEmail has enabled working
remotely with coauthors. This has allowed collaborationis which would not
otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research.Now, let's look at

<p>Introduction: I realized that the tools needed to solve theproblem just postedwere just
created. I tried to sketch out the solutionhere(also in.lyxand.tex). It is
still quite sketchy (and probably only the few people who understand
reductions well can follow).One of the reasons why I started this weblog was
to experiment with "research in the open", and this is an opportunity to do
so. Over the next few days, I'll be filling in details and trying to get
things to make sense. If you have additions or ideas, please propose them.</p><p>5 0.10786919 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>6 0.10728383 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The internet has recently made the research process much smoother: papers are
easy to obtain, citations are easy to follow, and unpublished "tutorials" are
often available. Yet, new research fields can look very complicated to
outsiders or newcomers. Every paper is like a small piece of an unfinished
jigsaw puzzle: to understand just one publication, a researcher without
experience in the field will typically have to follow several layers of
citations, and many of the papers he encounters have a great deal of repeated
information. Furthermore, from one publication to the next, notation and
terminology may not be consistent which can further confuse the reader.But the
internet is now proving to be an extremely useful medium for collaboration and
knowledge aggregation. Online forums allow users to ask and answer questions
and to share ideas. The recent phenomenon of Wikipedia provides a proof-of-
concept for the "anyone can edit" system. Can such models be used to
facilitate research and</p><p>4 0.68251067 <a title="1-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Makc asked a goodquestionin comments--"Why bother to make a paper, at all?"
There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately
obvious to people not in academia.The basic idea is that papers have
considerably more utility than the obvious "present an idea".Papers are a
formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged
on the number of papers they produce.Papers have a formalized method of citing
and crediting other--the bibliography. Academics (especially older ones) are
often judged on the number of citations they receive.Papers enable a "more
fair" anonymous review. Conferences receivemanypapers, from which a subset are
selected. Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants
to build a reputation for good work.Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.
Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to
friends about interesting problems while there. Sometimes you even solve
them.Papers are</p><p>5 0.68075436 <a title="1-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>6 0.6782409 <a title="1-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-02-Proprietary_Data_in_Academic_Research%3F.html">306 hunch net-2008-07-02-Proprietary Data in Academic Research?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For theChicago 2005 machine learning summer schoolwe are organizing, at least
5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>same-blog 4 0.85948163 <a title="1-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-19-Why_I_decided_to_run_a_weblog..html">1 hunch net-2005-01-19-Why I decided to run a weblog.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost
exclusively about new research, rather than evaluation (and consideration) of
research directions. This last role is satisfied by funding agencies to some
extent, but that is a private debate of</p><p>5 0.85332751 <a title="1-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-12-ICML_accepted_papers_and_early_registration.html">465 hunch net-2012-05-12-ICML accepted papers and early registration</a></p>
