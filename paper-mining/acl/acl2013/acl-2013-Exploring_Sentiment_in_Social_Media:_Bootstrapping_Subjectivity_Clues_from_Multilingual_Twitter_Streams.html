<p>Author: Alexandra Balahur ; Hristo Tanev</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of Social Media is constantly growing, as people often use such platforms to share mainstream media news and comment on the events that they relate to. As such, people no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content. This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral. In this manner, readers can follow the main events happening in the world, both from the perspective of mainstream as well as social media and the public’s perception on them. This system will be part of the EMM media monitoring framework working live and it will be demonstrated using Google Earth.</p><p>3 0.35784781 <a title="148-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Sentiment_Words_Using_an_Optimization-based_Model_without_Seed_Words.html">188 acl-2013-Identifying Sentiment Words Using an Optimization-based Model without Seed Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongliang Yu ; Zhi-Hong Deng ; Shiyingxue Li</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment Word Identification (SWI) is a basic technique in many sentiment analysis applications. Most existing researches exploit seed words, and lead to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based model for SWI.

<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>5 0.28902668 <a title="148-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Exploiting_Topic_based_Twitter_Sentiment_for_Stock_Prediction.html">147 acl-2013-Exploiting Topic based Twitter Sentiment for Stock Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianfeng Si ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Qing Li ; Huayi Li ; Xiaotie Deng</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a technique to leverage topic based sentiments from Twitter to help predict the stock market. We first utilize a continuous Dirichlet Process Mixture model to learn the daily topic set. Then, for each topic we derive its sentiment according to its opinion words distribution to build a sentiment time series. We then regress the stock index and the Twitter sentiment time series to predict the market. Experiments on real-life S&P100; Index show that our approach is effective and performs better than existing state-of-the-art non-topic based methods. 1</p><p>6 0.25995731 <a title="148-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Linking_Tweets_to_News%3A_A_Framework_to_Enrich_Short_Text_Data_in_Social_Media.html">233 acl-2013-Linking Tweets to News: A Framework to Enrich Short Text Data in Social Media</a></p>

<p>Author: Ankit Ramteke ; Akshat Malu ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; J. Saketha Nath</p><p>Abstract: Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in sentiment analysis, the former because of the lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands. In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at Akshat Malu Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. akshatmalu@ cse .i itb .ac .in J.

<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Xiaoqiang Luo ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Empty categories (EC) are artificial elements in Penn Treebanks motivated by the government-binding (GB) theory to explain certain language phenomena such as pro-drop. ECs are ubiquitous in languages like Chinese, but they are tacitly ignored in most machine translation (MT) work because of their elusive nature. In this paper we present a comprehensive treatment of ECs by first recovering them with a structured MaxEnt model with a rich set of syntactic and lexical features, and then incorporating the predicted ECs into a Chinese-to-English machine translation task through multiple approaches, including the extraction of EC-specific sparse features. We show that the recovered empty categories not only improve the word alignment quality, but also lead to significant improvements in a large-scale state-of-the-art syntactic MT system.</p><p>4 0.69985783 <a title="148-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Lightweight_and_High_Performance_Monolingual_Word_Aligner.html">9 acl-2013-A Lightweight and High Performance Monolingual Word Aligner</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Fast alignment is essential for many natural language tasks. But in the setting of monolingual alignment, previous work has not been able to align more than one sentence pair per second. We describe a discriminatively trained monolingual word aligner that uses a Conditional Random Field to globally decode the best alignment with features drawn from source and target sentences. Using just part-of-speech tags and WordNet as external resources, our aligner gives state-of-the-art result, while being an order-of-magnitude faster than the previous best performing system.</p><p>5 0.69847757 <a title="148-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-The_Role_of_Syntax_in_Vector_Space_Models_of_Compositional_Semantics.html">347 acl-2013-The Role of Syntax in Vector Space Models of Compositional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Karl Moritz Hermann ; Phil Blunsom</p><p>Abstract: Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing. In this paper we draw upon recent advances in the learning of vector space representations of sentential semantics and the transparent interface between syntax and semantics provided by Combinatory Categorial Grammar to introduce Combinatory Categorial Autoencoders. This model leverages the CCG combinatory operators to guide a non-linear transformation of meaning within a sentence. We use this model to learn high dimensional embeddings for sentences and evaluate them in a range of tasks, demonstrating that the incorporation of syntax allows a concise model to learn representations that are both effective and general.</p><p>6 0.69752169 <a title="148-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Large-scale_Semantic_Parsing_via_Schema_Matching_and_Lexicon_Extension.html">215 acl-2013-Large-scale Semantic Parsing via Schema Matching and Lexicon Extension</a></p>
