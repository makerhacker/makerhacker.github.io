<p>Author: Haroon Idrees, Imran Saleemi, Cody Seibert, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose to leverage multiple sources of information to compute an estimate of the number of individuals present in an extremely dense crowd visible in a single image. Due to problems including perspective, occlusion, clutter, and few pixels per person, counting by human detection in such images is almost impossible. Instead, our approach relies on multiple sources such as low confidence head detections, repetition of texture elements (using SIFT), and frequency-domain analysis to estimate counts, along with confidence associated with observing individuals, in an image region. Secondly, we employ a global consistency constraint on counts using Markov Random Field. This caters for disparity in counts in local neighborhoods and across scales. We tested our approach on a new dataset of fifty crowd images containing 64K annotated humans, with the head counts ranging from 94 to 4543. This is in stark con- trast to datasets usedfor existing methods which contain not more than tens of individuals. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach by quantifying the counting performance.</p><p>3 0.30792743 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Measuring_Crowd_Collectiveness.html">282 cvpr-2013-Measuring Crowd Collectiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Bolei Zhou, Xiaoou Tang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Collective motions are common in crowd systems and have attracted a great deal of attention in a variety of multidisciplinary fields. Collectiveness, which indicates the degree of individuals acting as a union in collective motion, is a fundamental and universal measurement for various crowd systems. By integrating path similarities among crowds on collective manifold, this paper proposes a descriptor of collectiveness and an efficient computation for the crowd and its constituent individuals. The algorithm of the Collective Merging is then proposed to detect collective motions from random motions. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed collectiveness descriptor on the system of self-driven particles. We then compare the collectiveness descriptor to human perception for collective motion and show high consistency. Our experiments regarding the detection of collective motions and the measurement of collectiveness in videos of pedestrian crowds and bacteria colony demonstrate a wide range of applications of the collectiveness descriptor1.</p><p>4 0.28374419 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang, Chen Change Loy</p><p>Abstract: A number of computer vision problems such as human age estimation, crowd density estimation and body/face pose (view angle) estimation can be formulated as a regression problem by learning a mapping function between a high dimensional vector-formed feature input and a scalarvalued output. Such a learning problem is made difficult due to sparse and imbalanced training data and large feature variations caused by both uncertain viewing conditions and intrinsic ambiguities between observable visual features and the scalar values to be estimated. Encouraged by the recent success in using attributes for solving classification problems with sparse training data, this paper introduces a novel cumulative attribute concept for learning a regression model when only sparse and imbalanced data are available. More precisely, low-level visual features extracted from sparse and imbalanced image samples are mapped onto a cumulative attribute space where each dimension has clearly defined semantic interpretation (a label) that captures how the scalar output value (e.g. age, people count) changes continuously and cumulatively. Extensive experiments show that our cumulative attribute framework gains notable advantage on accuracy for both age estimation and crowd counting when compared against conventional regression models, especially when the labelled training data is sparse with imbalanced sampling.</p><p>5 0.2031167 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Learning_to_Detect_Partially_Overlapping_Instances.html">264 cvpr-2013-Learning to Detect Partially Overlapping Instances</a></p>
<p>Author: Carlos Arteta, Victor Lempitsky, J. Alison Noble, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The objective of this work is to detect all instances of a class (such as cells or people) in an image. The instances may be partially overlapping and clustered, and hence quite challenging for traditional detectors, which aim at localizing individual instances. Our approach is to propose a set of candidate regions, and then select regions based on optimizing a global classification score, subject to the constraint that the selected regions are non-overlapping. Our novel contribution is to extend standard object detection by introducing separate classes for tuples of objects into the detection process. For example, our detector can pick a region containing two or three object instances, while assigning such region an appropriate label. We show that this formulation can be learned within the structured output SVM framework, and that the inference in such model can be accomplished using dynamic programming on a tree structured region graph. Furthermore, the learning only requires weak annotations – a dot on each instance. The improvement resulting from the addition of the capability to detect tuples of objects is demonstrated on quite disparate data sets: fluorescence microscopy images and UCSD pedestrians.</p><p>6 0.17954203 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Detecting_and_Naming_Actors_in_Movies_Using_Generative_Appearance_Models.html">120 cvpr-2013-Detecting and Naming Actors in Movies Using Generative Appearance Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: Recently, the Counting Grid (CG) model [5] was developed to represent each input image as a point in a large grid of feature counts. This latent point is a corner of a window of grid points which are all uniformly combined to match the (normalized) feature counts in the image. Being a bag of word model with spatial layout in the latent space, the CG model has superior handling of field of view changes in comparison to other bag of word models, but with the price of being essentially a mixture, mapping each scene to a single window in the grid. In this paper we introduce a family of componential models, dubbed the Componential Counting Grid, whose members represent each input image by multiple latent locations, rather than just one. In this way, we make a substantially more flexible admixture model which captures layers or parts of images and maps them to separate windows in a Counting Grid. We tested the models on scene and place classification where their com- ponential nature helped to extract objects, to capture parallax effects, thus better fitting the data and outperforming Counting Grids and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, especially on sequences taken with wearable cameras.</p><p>6 0.50924098 <a title="100-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Raffay Hamid, Dennis Decoste, Chih-Jen Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust and efficient technique for matching dense sets of points undergoing non-rigid spatial transformations. Our main intuition is that the subset of points that can be matched with high confidence should be used to guide the matching procedure for the rest. We propose a novel algorithm that incorporates these high-confidence matches as a spatial prior to learn a discriminative subspace that simultaneously encodes both the feature similarity as well as their spatial arrangement. Conventional subspace learning usually requires spectral decomposition of the pair-wise distance matrix across the point-sets, which can become inefficient even for moderately sized problems. To this end, we propose the use of random projections for approximate subspace learning, which can provide significant time improvements at the cost of minimal precision loss. This efficiency gain allows us to iteratively find and remove high-confidence matches from the point sets, resulting in high recall. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we present a systematic set of experiments and results for the problem of dense non-rigid image-feature matching.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81532973 <a title="100-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Crossing_the_Line%3A_Crowd_Counting_by_Integer_Programming_with_Local_Features.html">100 cvpr-2013-Crossing the Line: Crowd Counting by Integer Programming with Local Features</a></p>

Given that count in a sliding window is the sum of the instantaneous counts in the corresponding time interval, an integer programming method is proposed to recover the number of pedestrians crossing the line of interest in each frame. Integrating over a specific time interval yields the cumulative count of pedestrian crossing the line. Compared with current methods for line counting, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging crowd video datasets.</p><p>3 0.80363435 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Discriminative_Re-ranking_of_Diverse_Segmentations.html">132 cvpr-2013-Discriminative Re-ranking of Diverse Segmentations</a></p>
<p>Author: Payman Yadollahpour, Dhruv Batra, Gregory Shakhnarovich</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a two-stage approach to semantic image segmentation. In the first stage a probabilistic model generates a set of diverse plausible segmentations. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the probabilistic model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than possible by simply producing the most probable solution from the probabilistic model. While our proposed approach already achieves state-of-the-art results (48.1%) on the challenging VOC 2012 dataset, our machine and human analyses suggest that even larger gains are possible with such an approach.</p><p>4 0.80014551 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-GeoF%3A_Geodesic_Forests_for_Learning_Coupled_Predictors.html">186 cvpr-2013-GeoF: Geodesic Forests for Learning Coupled Predictors</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Kontschieder, Pushmeet Kohli, Jamie Shotton, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Conventional decision forest based methods for image labelling tasks like object segmentation make predictions for each variable (pixel) independently [3, 5, 8]. This prevents them from enforcing dependencies between variables and translates into locally inconsistent pixel labellings. Random field models, instead, encourage spatial consistency of labels at increased computational expense. This paper presents a new and efficient forest based model that achieves spatially consistent semantic image segmentation by encoding variable dependencies directly in the feature space the forests operate on. Such correlations are captured via new long-range, soft connectivity features, computed via generalized geodesic distance transforms. Our model can be thought of as a generalization of the successful Semantic Texton Forest, Auto-Context, and Entangled Forest models. A second contribution is to show the connection between the typical Conditional Random Field (CRF) energy and the forest training objective. This analysis yields a new objective for training decision forests that encourages more accurate structured prediction. Our GeoF model is validated quantitatively on the task of semantic image segmentation, on four challenging and very diverse image datasets. GeoF outperforms both stateof-the-art forest models and the conventional pairwise CRF.</p><p>5 0.79019576 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Cumulative_Attribute_Space_for_Age_and_Crowd_Density_Estimation.html">101 cvpr-2013-Cumulative Attribute Space for Age and Crowd Density Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Chen, Shaogang Gong, Tao Xiang, Chen Change Loy</p><p>Abstract: A number of computer vision problems such as human age estimation, crowd density estimation and body/face pose (view angle) estimation can be formulated as a regression problem by learning a mapping function between a high dimensional vector-formed feature input and a scalarvalued output. Such a learning problem is made difficult due to sparse and imbalanced training data and large feature variations caused by both uncertain viewing conditions and intrinsic ambiguities between observable visual features and the scalar values to be estimated. Encouraged by the recent success in using attributes for solving classification problems with sparse training data, this paper introduces a novel cumulative attribute concept for learning a regression model when only sparse and imbalanced data are available. More precisely, low-level visual features extracted from sparse and imbalanced image samples are mapped onto a cumulative attribute space where each dimension has clearly defined semantic interpretation (a label) that captures how the scalar output value (e.g. age, people count) changes continuously and cumulatively. Extensive experiments show that our cumulative attribute framework gains notable advantage on accuracy for both age estimation and crowd counting when compared against conventional regression models, especially when the labelled training data is sparse with imbalanced sampling.</p><p>6 0.76747602 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Tracking_People_and_Their_Objects.html">440 cvpr-2013-Tracking People and Their Objects</a></p>
