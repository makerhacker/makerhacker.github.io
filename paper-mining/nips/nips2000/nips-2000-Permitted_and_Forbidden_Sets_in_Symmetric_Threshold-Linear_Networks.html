We study symmetric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks composed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigenmodes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming. Also, we show that there are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state and forbidden sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden. By viewing permitted sets as memories stored in the synaptic connections, we can provide a formulation of longterm memory that is more general than the traditional perspective of fixed point attractor networks. A Lyapunov-function can be used to prove that a given set of differential equations is convergent. For example, if a neural network possesses a Lyapunov-function, then for almost any initial condition, the outputs of the neurons converge to a stable steady state. In the past, this stability-property was used to construct attractor networks that associatively recall memorized patterns. Lyapunov theory applies mainly to symmetric networks in which neurons have monotonic activation functions [1, 2].

</p><p>10 Alternatively, they can be expressed in terms of certain eigenvalues and eigenvectors of submatrices of the synaptic weight matrix, making a connection to linear systems theory. [sent-27, score-0.296]
</p><p>11 The theorem guarantees that  the network will produce a steady state response to any constant input. [sent-28, score-0.624]
</p><p>12 In the second theorem, we introduce the idea of permitted and forbidden sets. [sent-30, score-0.951]
</p><p>13 Under certain conditions on the synaptic weight matrix, we show that there exist sets of neurons that are "forbidden" by the recurrent synaptic connections from being coactivated at a stable steady state, no matter what input is applied. [sent-31, score-1.256]
</p><p>14 Other sets are "permitted," in the sense that they can be coactivated for some input. [sent-32, score-0.202]
</p><p>15 The same conditions on the synaptic weight matrix also lead to conditional multistability, meaning that there exists an input for which there is more than one stable steady state. [sent-33, score-0.798]
</p><p>16 In other words, forbidden sets and conditional multistability are inseparable concepts. [sent-34, score-0.54]
</p><p>17 The existence of permitted and forbidden sets suggests a new way of thinking about memory in neural networks. [sent-35, score-1.158]
</p><p>18 When an input is applied, the network must select a set of active neurons, and this selection is constrained to be one of the permitted sets. [sent-36, score-0.806]
</p><p>19 Therefore the permitted sets can be regarded as memories stored in the synaptic connections. [sent-37, score-0.956]
</p><p>20 Our third theorem states that there are constraints on the groups of permitted and forbidden sets that can be stored by a network. [sent-38, score-1.286]
</p><p>21 No matter which learning algorithm is used to store memories, active neurons cannot arbitrarily be divided into permitted and forbidden sets, because subsets of permitted sets have to be permitted and supersets of forbidden sets have to be forbidden. [sent-39, score-3.178]

</p><p>23 The existence of outputs and their relationship to the input are determined by the synaptic weight matrix W. [sent-50, score-0.248]
</p><p>24 The nonnegative orthant {v : v ~ O} is the set of all nonnegative vectors. [sent-52, score-0.437]
</p><p>25 It can be shown that any trajectory starting in the nonnegative orthant remains in the nonnegative orthant. [sent-53, score-0.477]
</p><p>26 Therefore, for simplicity we will consider initial conditions that are confined to the nonnegative orthant x ~ O. [sent-54, score-0.332]

</p><p>29 A steady state is asymptotically stable if for all initial conditions sufficiently close to ;! [sent-62, score-0.716]
</p><p>30 A set of steady states is globally asymptotically stable if from almost all initial  conditions, state trajectories converge to one of the steady states. [sent-67, score-1.121]
</p><p>31 Definition 2 A principal submatrix A of a square matrix B is a square matrix that is constructed by deleting a certain set of rows and the corresponding columns of B. [sent-69, score-0.309]
</p><p>32 The following theorem establishes necessary and sufficient conditions on W for global asymptotic stability. [sent-70, score-0.27]
</p><p>33 All nonnegative eigenvectors of all principal submatrices of I - W have positive eigenvalues. [sent-72, score-0.398]
</p><p>34 For all b, the network has a nonempty set of steady states that are globally asymptotically stable. [sent-77, score-0.62]
</p><p>35 Let v* be the minimum of vT(I - W)v over nonnegative v on the unit sphere. [sent-79, score-0.223]
</p><p>36 It follows from Lagrange multiplier methods that the nonzero elements of v* comprise a nonnegative eigenvector of the corresponding principal submatrix of W with eigenvalue greater than or equal to unity. [sent-81, score-0.445]
</p><p>37 It is also nonincreasing under the network dynamics in the nonnegative orthant, and constant only at steady states. [sent-84, score-0.654]
</p><p>38 By the Lyapunov stability theorem, the stable steady states are globally asymptotically stable. [sent-85, score-0.764]
</p><p>39 In the language of optimization theory, the network dynamics converges to a local minimum of L subject to the nonnegativity constraint x ~ O. [sent-86, score-0.178]
</p><p>40 Then there exists a nonnegative eigenvector of a principal submatrix of W with eigenvalue greater than or equal to unity. [sent-89, score-0.474]
</p><p>41 • The meaning of these stability conditions is best appreciated by comparing with the analogous conditions for the purely linear network obtained by dropping the rectification from (1). [sent-91, score-0.363]
</p><p>42 Here only nonnegative eigenvectors are able to grow without bound, due to the rectification, so that only their eigenvalues must be less than unity. [sent-93, score-0.309]
</p><p>43 All principal submatrices of W must be considered, because different sets of feedback connections are active, depending on the set of neurons that are above threshold. [sent-94, score-0.468]
</p><p>44 In a linear network, I - W would have to be positive definite to ensure asymptotic stability, but because of the rectification, here this condition is replaced by the weaker condition of copositivity. [sent-95, score-0.18]
</p><p>45 The conditions of Theorem 1 for global asymptotic stability depend only on W, but not on b. [sent-96, score-0.24]
</p><p>46 Lemma 1 For any nonnegative vector v a steady state of equation 1 with input b. [sent-99, score-0.622]
</p><p>47 •  This Lemma states that any nonnegative vector can be realized as a fixed point. [sent-105, score-0.274]
</p><p>48 Indeed, the principal submatrix of I - W corresponding to a single active neuron corresponds to a diagonal elements, which according to (1) must be positive. [sent-107, score-0.278]
</p><p>49 Hence it is always possible to activate only a single neuron at an asymptotically stable fixed point. [sent-108, score-0.328]
</p><p>50 However, as will become clear from the following Theorem, not all nonnegative vectors can be realized as an asymptotically stable fixed point. [sent-109, score-0.486]
</p><p>51 3  Forbidden and permitted sets  The following characterizations of stable steady states are based on the interlacing Theorem [4]. [sent-110, score-1.327]
</p><p>52 This Theorem says that if A is an - 1 by n - 1 principal submatrix of a n by n symmetric matrix B, then the eigenvalues of A fall in between the eigenvalues of B. [sent-111, score-0.486]
</p><p>53 Definition 3 A set of neurons is permitted if the neurons can be coactivated at an asymptotically stable steady state for some input b. [sent-113, score-1.779]
</p><p>54 On the other hand, a set of neurons is forbidden, if they cannot be coactivated at an asymptotically stable steady state no matter what the input b. [sent-114, score-0.972]
</p><p>55 Alternatively, we might have defined a permitted set as a set for which the corresponding square sub-matrix of I - W has only positive eigenvalues. [sent-115, score-0.698]
</p><p>56 And, similarly, a forbidden set could be defined as a set for which there is at least one non-positive eigenvalue. [sent-116, score-0.322]
</p><p>57 It follows from Theorem 1 that if the matrix I - W is copositive, then the eigenvectors corresponding to non-positive eigenvalues of forbidden sets have to have both positive and non-positive components. [sent-117, score-0.679]
</p><p>58 That is, there exists an input b such that there is more than one stable steady state. [sent-124, score-0.547]
</p><p>59 I - W is not positive definite and so there can be no asymptotically stable steady state in which all neurons are active, e. [sent-126, score-0.922]
</p><p>60 Denote the forbidden set with k active neurons by 1::. [sent-130, score-0.588]
</p><p>61 By choosing bi > 0 for neurons i belonging to 1; and bj « 0 for neurons j not belonging to 1;, the quadratic Lyapunov function L defined in Theorem 1 forms a saddle in the nonnegative quadrant defined by 1;. [sent-132, score-0.651]
</p><p>62 But because neurons can be initialized to lower values of L on either side of the hyperplane and because L is non-increasing along trajectories, there is no way trajectories can cross the hyperplane. [sent-134, score-0.237]
</p><p>63 • If I - W is positive definite, then a symmetric threshold-linear network has a unique steady state. [sent-141, score-0.551]
</p><p>64 The next Theorem is an expansion of this result, stating an equivalent condition using the concept of permitted sets. [sent-143, score-0.677]
</p><p>65 For all b there is a unique steady state, and it is stable. [sent-149, score-0.351]
</p><p>66 Suppose (1) is false, so the set of all neurons active must be forbidden, not all sets are permitted. [sent-156, score-0.403]
</p><p>67 • The following Theorem characterizes the forbidden and the permitted sets. [sent-159, score-0.951]
</p><p>68 Theorem 4 Any subset of a permitted set is permitted. [sent-160, score-0.629]
</p><p>69 Proof: According to the interlacing Theorem, if the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix is positive, then so are the smallest eigenvalues of all its principal submatrices. [sent-162, score-0.469]
</p><p>70 And, if the smallest eigenvalue of a principal submatrix is negative, then so is the smallest eigenvalue of the original matrix . [sent-163, score-0.423]
</p><p>71 •  4  An example - the ring network  A symmetric threshold-linear network with local excitation and larger range inhibition has been studied in the past as a model for how simple cells in primary visual cortex obtain their orientation tuning to visual stimulation [6, 7]. [sent-164, score-0.445]
</p><p>72 We have argued that the fixed tuning width of the neurons in the network arises because active sets consisting of more than a fixed  number of contiguous neurons are forbidden. [sent-166, score-0.855]
</p><p>73 Here we give a more detailed account of this fact and provide a surprising result about the existence of some spurious permitted sets. [sent-167, score-0.708]
</p><p>74 Let the synaptic matrix of a 10 neuron ring-network be translationally invariant. [sent-168, score-0.205]
</p><p>75 The connection between neurons i and j is given by Wij = -(3 +o:oclij + 0:1 (cli,j+l + cli+l,j) + 0:2 (cli,j+2 + cli+2,j), where (3 quantifies global inhibition, 0:0 self-excitation, 0:1 first-neighbor lateral excitation and 0:2 second-neighbor lateral excitation. [sent-169, score-0.341]
</p><p>76 In Figure 1 we have numerically computed the permitted sets of this network, with the parameters taken from [3], e. [sent-170, score-0.766]
</p><p>77 The permitted sets were determined by diagonalising the 210 square sub-matrices of I - W and by classifying the eigenvalues corresponding to nonnegative eigenvectors. [sent-175, score-1.059]
</p><p>78 The Figure 1 shows the resulting parent permitted sets (those that have no permitted supersets). [sent-176, score-1.446]
</p><p>79 Consistent with the finding that such ring-networks can explain contrast invariant tuning of VI cells and multiplicative response modulation of parietal cells, we found that there are no permitted sets that consist of more than 5 contiguous active neurons. [sent-177, score-0.945]
</p><p>80 However, as can be seen, there are many non-contiguous permitted sets that could in principle be activated by exciting neurons in white and strongly inhibiting neurons in black. [sent-178, score-1.18]
</p><p>81 Neuron number  Neuron number  Figure 1: Left: Output of a ring network of 10 neurons to uniform input (random initial condition). [sent-192, score-0.441]
</p><p>82 Right: The 9 parent permitted sets (x-axis: neuron number, y-axis: set number). [sent-193, score-0.873]
</p><p>83 White means that a neurons belongs to a set and black means that it does not. [sent-194, score-0.207]
</p><p>84 Left-right and translation symmetric parent permitted sets of the ones shown have been excluded. [sent-195, score-0.89]
</p><p>85 The first parent permitted set (first row from the bottom) corresponds to the output on the left. [sent-196, score-0.68]
</p><p>86 5  Discussion  We have shown that pattern memorization in threshold linear networks can be viewed in terms of permitted sets of neurons, e. [sent-197, score-0.793]
</p><p>87 sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state. [sent-199, score-0.743]
</p><p>88 According to this definition, the memories are stored by the synaptic weights, independently of the inputs. [sent-200, score-0.19]
</p><p>89 A typical input will not allow for the retrieval of arbitrary stored permitted sets. [sent-203, score-0.737]
</p><p>90 This comes from the fact that multistability is not just dependent on the existence of forbidden sets, but also on the input (theorem 2). [sent-204, score-0.479]
</p><p>91 For example, in the ring network, positive input will always retrieve permitted sets consisting of a group of contiguous neurons, but not any of the spurious permitted sets, Figure 1. [sent-205, score-1.65]
</p><p>92 Generally, multistability in the ring network is only possible when more than a single neuron is excited. [sent-206, score-0.304]
</p><p>93 Notice that threshold-linear networks can behave as traditional attractor networks when the inputs are represented as initial conditions of the dynamics. [sent-207, score-0.182]
</p><p>94 For example, by fixing b = 1 and initializing a copositive network with some input, the permitted sets unequivocally determine the stable fixed points. [sent-208, score-1.063]
</p><p>95 Thus, in this case, the notion of permitted sets is no different from fixed point attractors. [sent-209, score-0.8]
</p><p>96 However, the hierarchical grouping of permitted sets (Theorem 4) becomes irrelevant, since there can be only one attractive fixed point per hierarchical group defined by a parent permitted set. [sent-210, score-1.504]
</p><p>97 The fact that no permitted set can have a forbidden subset represents a constraint on the possible computations of symmetric networks. [sent-211, score-1.054]
</p><p>98 In a similar way, grouping problems that do not obey the natural hierarchy inherent in symmetric networks, might necessitate the introduction of hidden neurons to realize the right geometry. [sent-215, score-0.304]
</p><p>99 For the interested reader, see also [8] for a simple procedure of how to store a given family of possibly overlapping patterns as permitted sets. [sent-216, score-0.651]

We study symmetric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks composed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigenmodes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming.

<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analysis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some degenerate cases.

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H.

Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule.

<p>Author: Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: Ascribing computational principles to neural feedback circuits is an important problem in theoretical neuroscience. We study symmetric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks composed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigenmodes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming. Also, we show that there are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state and forbidden sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden. By viewing permitted sets as memories stored in the synaptic connections, we can provide a formulation of longterm memory that is more general than the traditional perspective of fixed point attractor networks. A Lyapunov-function can be used to prove that a given set of differential equations is convergent. For example, if a neural network possesses a Lyapunov-function, then for almost any initial condition, the outputs of the neurons converge to a stable steady state. In the past, this stability-property was used to construct attractor networks that associatively recall memorized patterns. Lyapunov theory applies mainly to symmetric networks in which neurons have monotonic activation functions [1, 2]. Here we show that the restriction of activation functions to threshold-linear ones is not a mere limitation, but can yield new insights into the computational behavior of recurrent networks (for completeness, see also [3]). We present three main theorems about the neural responses to constant inputs. The first theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the synaptic weight matrix for the existence of a globally asymptotically stable set of fixed points. These conditions can be expressed in terms of copositivity, a concept from quadratic programming and linear complementarity theory. Alternatively, they can be expressed in terms of certain eigenvalues and eigenvectors of submatrices of the synaptic weight matrix, making a connection to linear systems theory. The theorem guarantees that the network will produce a steady state response to any constant input. We regard this response as the computational output of the network, and its characterization is the topic of the second and third theorems. In the second theorem, we introduce the idea of permitted and forbidden sets.

<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

Recently, there has been much effort on enhancing the Perceptron algorithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the Winnow algorithm, which gives methods we call regularized Winnows. We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic Winnows in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic issues and learning properties of the derived methods.
