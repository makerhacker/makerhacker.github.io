<p>Author: Huaizu Jiang, Jingdong Wang, Zejian Yuan, Yang Wu, Nanning Zheng, Shipeng Li</p><p>Abstract: Salient object detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. In this paper, we regard saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, uses the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score, and finally fuses the saliency scores across multiple levels, yielding the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we show our approach, which integrates the regional contrast, regional property and regional backgroundness descriptors together to form the master saliency map, is able to produce superior saliency maps to existing algorithms most of which combine saliency maps heuristically computed from different types of features. The other is that we introduce a new regional feature vector, backgroundness, to characterize the background, which can be regarded as a counterpart of the objectness descriptor [2].

<p>Author: Chuan Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing bottom-up methods measure the foreground saliency of a pixel or region based on its contrast within a local context or the entire image, whereas a few methods focus on segmenting out background regions and thereby salient objects. Instead of considering the contrast between the salient objects and their surrounding regions, we consider both foreground and background cues in a different way. We rank the similarity of the image elements (pixels or regions) with foreground cues or background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of the image elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or queries. We represent the image as a close-loop graph with superpixels as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on the similarity to background and foreground queries, based on affinity matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a two-stage scheme to extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. Experimental results on two large benchmark databases demonstrate the proposed method performs well when against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We also create a more difficult bench- mark database containing 5,172 images to test the proposed saliency model and make this database publicly available with this paper for further studies in the saliency field.</p><p>4 0.59874719 <a title="411-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. –</p><p>5 0.56980401 <a title="411-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-PISA%3A_Pixelwise_Image_Saliency_by_Aggregating_Complementary_Appearance_Contrast_Measures_with_Spatial_Priors.html">322 cvpr-2013-PISA: Pixelwise Image Saliency by Aggregating Complementary Appearance Contrast Measures with Spatial Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Keyang Shi, Keze Wang, Jiangbo Lu, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, assigning pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly critical. More often, such fine-grained saliency detection is also desired to have a fast runtime. Motivated by these, we propose a generic and fast computational framework called PISA Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating complementary saliency cues based on color and structure contrasts with spatial priors holistically. Overcoming the limitations of previous methods often using homogeneous superpixel-based and color contrast-only treatment, our PISA approach directly performs saliency modeling for each individual pixel and makes use of densely overlapping, feature-adaptive observations for saliency measure computation. We further impose a spatial prior term on each of the two contrast measures, which constrains pixels rendered salient to be compact and also centered in image domain. By fusing complementary contrast measures in such a pixelwise adaptive manner, the detection effectiveness is significantly boosted. Without requiring reliable region segmentation or post– relaxation, PISA exploits an efficient edge-aware image representation and filtering technique and produces spatially coherent yet detail-preserving saliency maps. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate PISA’s superior detection accuracy and competitive runtime speed over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p><p>6 0.53408372 <a title="411-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Mai, Yuzhen Niu, Feng Liu</p><p>Abstract: A variety of methods have been developed for visual saliency analysis. These methods often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of aggregating various saliency analysis methods such that the aggregation result outperforms each individual one. We have two major observations. First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboringpixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.</p><p>2 0.95262408 <a title="411-lsi-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Salient_Object_Detection%3A_A_Discriminative_Regional_Feature_Integration_Approach.html">376 cvpr-2013-Salient Object Detection: A Discriminative Regional Feature Integration Approach</a></p>

Experimental results using a public natural image dataset and a variety of performance evaluation metrics show that the proposed approach provides interesting and promising results when compared to existing saliency detection methods.</p><p>2 0.96781653 <a title="411-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Representing_Videos_Using_Mid-level_Discriminative_Patches.html">355 cvpr-2013-Representing Videos Using Mid-level Discriminative Patches</a></p>
<p>Author: Arpit Jain, Abhinav Gupta, Mikel Rodriguez, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: How should a video be represented? We propose a new representation for videos based on mid-level discriminative spatio-temporal patches. These spatio-temporal patches might correspond to a primitive human action, a semantic object, or perhaps a random but informative spatiotemporal patch in the video. What defines these spatiotemporal patches is their discriminative and representative properties. We automatically mine these patches from hundreds of training videos and experimentally demonstrate that these patches establish correspondence across videos and align the videos for label transfer techniques. Furthermore, these patches can be used as a discriminative vocabulary for action classification where they demonstrate stateof-the-art performance on UCF50 and Olympics datasets.</p><p>3 0.96734232 <a title="411-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Context-Aware_Modeling_and_Recognition_of_Activities_in_Video.html">94 cvpr-2013-Context-Aware Modeling and Recognition of Activities in Video</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingying Zhu, Nandita M. Nayak, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury</p><p>Abstract: In thispaper, rather than modeling activities in videos individually, we propose a hierarchical framework that jointly models and recognizes related activities using motion and various context features. This is motivated from the observations that the activities related in space and time rarely occur independently and can serve as the context for each other. Given a video, action segments are automatically detected using motion segmentation based on a nonlinear dynamical model. We aim to merge these segments into activities of interest and generate optimum labels for the activities. Towards this goal, we utilize a structural model in a max-margin framework that jointly models the underlying activities which are related in space and time. The model explicitly learns the duration, motion and context patterns for each activity class, as well as the spatio-temporal relationships for groups of them. The learned model is then used to optimally label the activities in the testing videos using a greedy search method. We show promising results on the VIRAT Ground Dataset demonstrating the benefit of joint modeling and recognizing activities in a wide-area scene.</p><p>4 0.96685618 <a title="411-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Blocks_That_Shout%3A_Distinctive_Parts_for_Scene_Classification.html">67 cvpr-2013-Blocks That Shout: Distinctive Parts for Scene Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mayank Juneja, Andrea Vedaldi, C.V. Jawahar, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: The automatic discovery of distinctive parts for an object or scene class is challenging since it requires simultaneously to learn the part appearance and also to identify the part occurrences in images. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient, and effective method to do so. We address this problem by learning parts incrementally, starting from a single part occurrence with an Exemplar SVM. In this manner, additional part instances are discovered and aligned reliably before being considered as training examples. We also propose entropy-rank curves as a means of evaluating the distinctiveness of parts shareable between categories and use them to select useful parts out of a set of candidates. We apply the new representation to the task of scene categorisation on the MIT Scene 67 benchmark. We show that our method can learn parts which are significantly more informative and for a fraction of the cost, compared to previouspart-learning methods such as Singh et al. [28]. We also show that a well constructed bag of words or Fisher vector model can substantially outperform the previous state-of- the-art classification performance on this data.</p><p>5 0.96668673 <a title="411-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Pixel-Level_Hand_Detection_in_Ego-centric_Videos.html">332 cvpr-2013-Pixel-Level Hand Detection in Ego-centric Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng Li, Kris M. Kitani</p><p>Abstract: We address the task of pixel-level hand detection in the context of ego-centric cameras. Extracting hand regions in ego-centric videos is a critical step for understanding handobject manipulation and analyzing hand-eye coordination. However, in contrast to traditional applications of hand detection, such as gesture interfaces or sign-language recognition, ego-centric videos present new challenges such as rapid changes in illuminations, significant camera motion and complex hand-object manipulations. To quantify the challenges and performance in this new domain, we present a fully labeled indoor/outdoor ego-centric hand detection benchmark dataset containing over 200 million labeled pixels, which contains hand images taken under various illumination conditions. Using both our dataset and a publicly available ego-centric indoors dataset, we give extensive analysis of detection performance using a wide range of local appearance features. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of sparse features and the importance of modeling global illumination. We propose a modeling strategy based on our findings and show that our model outperforms several baseline approaches.</p><p>6 0.9666546 <a title="411-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Generalized_Domain-Adaptive_Dictionaries.html">185 cvpr-2013-Generalized Domain-Adaptive Dictionaries</a></p>
