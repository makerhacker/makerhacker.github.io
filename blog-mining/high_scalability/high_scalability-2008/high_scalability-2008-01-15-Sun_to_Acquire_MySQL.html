<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>5 0.11680085 <a title="214-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-17-Sun_to_Announce_Open_Cloud_APIs_at_CommunityOne.html">543 high scalability-2009-03-17-Sun to Announce Open Cloud APIs at CommunityOne</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The 5th annual MySQL Conference & Expo, co-presented by Sun Microsystems,
MySQL and O'Reilly Media.HappeningApril 20-23, 2009 in Santa Clara, CA, at the

open source and database enthusiasts together to harness the power of MySQL
and celebrate the huge MySQL ecosystem. All around the world, people just like
you are innovating with MySQLâ&euro;&rdquo;and MySQL is fueling the innovation engine by
releasing new mission critical solutions to help you work smarter. This deeply
technical conference brings all of that creativity, energy, and knowledge
together in one place for four very full days.Early registration ends February
16, 2009.The largest gathering of MySQL developers, users, and DBAs worldwide,

<p>Introduction: Sun is buying MySQL for $1 billion. The MySQL team has worked long and hard so
I don't begrudge them their pay day. Strike while the iron is offering a lot
of cash I say. And I have nothing against Sun. Yet I can't help but think this
changes the mental calculation of what database to use. When Oracle acquired
Innobase a new independent storage engine was needed for MySQL. How is this
different? Does this change your thinking any? Would Martha say it's a good
thing? Like Luke I've searched my feelings, but the force is not with me and I
don't really know how I feel about it.</p><p>6 0.70798075 <a title="214-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-18-Scaling_Mania_at_MySQL_Conference_2008.html">303 high scalability-2008-04-18-Scaling Mania at MySQL Conference 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lighttpd(pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure,
fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.Load-balancing FastCGI, SCGI
