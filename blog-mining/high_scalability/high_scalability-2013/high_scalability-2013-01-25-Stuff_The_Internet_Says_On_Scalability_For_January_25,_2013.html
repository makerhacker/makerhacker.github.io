<p>Introduction: TheEuroSys 2012system conference has an excellent live blog summary of their
talks for:Day 1,Day 2,Day 3(thanksHenry at the Paper Trail blog). Summaries
for each of the accepted papers arehere.One of the more interesting papers
from a NoSQL perspective wasCache Craftiness for Fast Multicore Key-Value
Storage, a wonderfully detailed description of the low level techniques used
to implement Masstree:A storage system specialized for key-value data in which
all data ﬁts in memory, but must persist across server restarts. It supports
arbitrary, variable-length keys. It allows range queries over those keys:
clients can traverse subsets of the database, or the whole database, in sorted
order by key. On a 16-core machine Masstree achieves six to ten million
operations per second on parts A-C of the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark
benchmark, more than 30 as fast as VoltDB [5] or MongoDB [2].If you are
looking for innovative detailed high performance design, this paper is for
you. An example fro</p><p>4 0.086211614 <a title="1394-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Photobucket.html">44 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Photobucket</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are
hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>4 0.52732337 <a title="1394-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-01-Paper%3A_Can_Programming_Be_Liberated_From_The_Von_Neumann_Style%3F_.html">1641 high scalability-2014-05-01-Paper: Can Programming Be Liberated From The Von Neumann Style? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist John Backus, he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and
the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled Can programming be
liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of
programs, that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after
it was published in 1977. It's the now familiar argument for why functional
programming is superior:The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck
of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much
the same way the computer's bottleneck does....The second world of
conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary
statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other
statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a
computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment
statement.Here's a response by DijkstraA review of the 1977 Turing Award

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>4 0.59307772 <a title="1394-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Digg_-_Looking_to_the_Future_with_Cassandra.html">732 high scalability-2009-10-29-Digg - Looking to the Future with Cassandra</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>5 0.58352911 <a title="1394-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-13-Paper%3A_NoSQL_Databases_-_NoSQL_Introduction_and_Overview.html">1022 high scalability-2011-04-13-Paper: NoSQL Databases - NoSQL Introduction and Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible
120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a
distribution-aware design of DBMSs.The paper then introduces fundamental
concepts, techniques</p><p>6 0.56996572 <a title="1394-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-How_Google%27s_Instant_Previews_Reduces_HTTP_Requests.html">941 high scalability-2010-11-15-How Google's Instant Previews Reduces HTTP Requests</a></p>
