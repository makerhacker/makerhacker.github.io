<p>Introduction: When we last  visited WhatsApp  they’d just been acquired by Facebook for $19 billion. We learned about their early architecture, which centered around a maniacal focus on optimizing Erlang into handling 2 million connections a server, working on All The Phones, and making users happy through simplicity.
   Two years later traffic has grown 10x. How did WhatsApp make that jump to the next level of scalability?

<p>Introduction: Update :  Erlang at Facebook  by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support.  
 
I've done some  XMPP  development so when I read  Facebook was making a Jabber chat client  I was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to make this puppy scale and perform.  It's not clear what extensions they've  implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.
 
A web based Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time open connection.

I don't know how much of this information is still current, but it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs.

<p>Introduction: Our latest strategy is taken from a  great post by Paul Saab of Facebook , detailing how with changes Facebook has made to memcached they have:
  ...been able to scale memcached to handle 200,000 UDP requests per second with an average latency of 173 microseconds. The total throughput achieved is 300,000 UDP requests/s, but the latency at that request rate is too high to be useful in our system. This is an amazing increase from 50,000 UDP requests/s using the stock version of Linux and memcached.  
To scale Facebook has hundreds of thousands of TCP connections open to their memcached processes. First, this is still amazing. It's not so long ago you could have never done this. Optimizing connection use was always a priority because the OS simply couldn't handle large numbers of connections or large numbers of threads or large numbers of CPUs. To get to this point is a big accomplishment. Still, at that scale there are problems that are often solved.  Some of the problem Facebook faced a</p><p>4 0.79886419 <a title="1602-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-04-How_Facebook_Handled_the_New_Year%27s_Eve_Onslaught.html">1168 high scalability-2012-01-04-How Facebook Handled the New Year's Eve Onslaught</a></p>

  Problem Setup   
 Facebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be shared on New Year's eve. 
 Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average of 130 friends. 
 Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then rendered. 
 Different events put different stresses on different parts of Facebook.       
 
 Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of capacity  
 News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve Jobs drive user status updates

<p>Introduction: When we last  visited WhatsApp  they’d just been acquired by Facebook for $19 billion. We learned about their early architecture, which centered around a maniacal focus on optimizing Erlang into handling 2 million connections a server, working on All The Phones, and making users happy through simplicity.
   Two years later traffic has grown 10x. How did WhatsApp make that jump to the next level of scalability? 
    Rick Reed    tells us in a talk he gave at the Erlang Factory:    That's 'Billion' with a 'B': Scaling to the next level at WhatsApp    (   slides   ), which revealed some eye popping WhatsApp stats:

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time (with so much cool info this week it will blow your mind):
     Amazing microscope image of a carnivorous bladderwort    
  How many drones would it take to replace Santa?  With a fleet of some 80 million or so F-16 drones the entire worldwide delivery could be completed in just over eight hours. Impressive, but a world without Rudolf is not a world I wish to contemplate. 
 Quotable Quotes:                                                
 
  @Loh : Always wanted to travel back in time to try fighting a younger version of yourself? Software development is the career for you! 
  @mraleph : often devs still approach performance of JS code as if they are riding a horse cart but the horse had long been replaced with fusion reactor 
  @peakscale : "The c3.large is 40% faster and has more than double the memory than the c1.medium but costs about the same"

 eBay:  tens of millions  of lines of code; Google code base change rate per month:  50% ; Apple:  100 million downloads ; Internet:  186 Gbps  
 Quotable quotes:                  
 
  @OttmarAmann  : Scalability is not as important as managing complexity  
  @amankapur91  : Does scalability imply standardization, and then does standardization imply loss of innovation? 
 
 
 Spotify uses a P2P architecture and this paper,  Spotify – Large Scale, Low Latency, P2P Music-on-Demand Streaming , describes it. 
  The Faving spam counter-measures . Ironically, deviantART relates a gripping story of how they detected and stopped a deviant user from attacking their servers with an automated faving script which faved every 10 seconds for 24 hours a day. The same spam filter they use on the rest of the site was used. Problem solved. Would like detail on their spam filter though.

<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies  HighScalability : 
  
  Google now 10x better : MapReduce sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes;  1 Billion on Social Networks ;  Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts ;  Twitter at 100 Million Users ;  Testing at Google Scale : 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60 million tests run daily. 
 From the  Dash Memo  on Google's Plan:  Go is a very promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next few years.  On GAE  Go can load from  a cold start in 100ms and the typical instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at scale?

  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.
