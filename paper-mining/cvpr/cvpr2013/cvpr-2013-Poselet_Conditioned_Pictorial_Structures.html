<p>Author: Fang Wang, Yi Li</p><p>Abstract: Simple tree models for articulated objects prevails in the last decade. However, it is also believed that these simple tree models are not capable of capturing large variations in many scenarios, such as human pose estimation. This paper attempts to address three questions: 1) are simple tree models sufficient? more specifically, 2) how to use tree models effectively in human pose estimation? and 3) how shall we use combined parts together with single parts efficiently? Assuming we have a set of single parts and combined parts, and the goal is to estimate a joint distribution of their locations. We surprisingly find that no latent variables are introduced in the Leeds Sport Dataset (LSP) during learning latent trees for deformable model, which aims at approximating the joint distributions of body part locations using minimal tree structure. This suggests one can straightforwardly use a mixed representation of single and combined parts to approximate their joint distribution in a simple tree model. As such, one only needs to build Visual Categories of the combined parts, and then perform inference on the learned latent tree. Our method outperformed the state of the art on the LSP, both in the scenarios when the training images are from the same dataset and from the PARSE dataset. Experiments on animal images from the VOC challenge further support our findings.</p><p>3 0.3673614 <a title="335-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_Body_Parts_Dependent_Joint_Regressors.html">206 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using Body Parts Dependent Joint Regressors</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Dantone, Juergen Gall, Christian Leistner, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of estimating 2d human pose from still images. Recent methods that rely on discriminatively trained deformable parts organized in a tree model have shown to be very successful in solving this task. Within such a pictorial structure framework, we address the problem of obtaining good part templates by proposing novel, non-linear joint regressors. In particular, we employ two-layered random forests as joint regressors. The first layer acts as a discriminative, independent body part classifier. The second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This results in a pose estimation framework that takes dependencies between body parts already for joint localization into account and is thus able to circumvent typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as for legs and arms. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our body parts dependent joint regressors achieve a higher joint localization accuracy than tree-based state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.27604935 <a title="335-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Pose_from_Flow_and_Flow_from_Pose.html">334 cvpr-2013-Pose from Flow and Flow from Pose</a></p>
<p>Author: Katerina Fragkiadaki, Han Hu, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Human pose detectors, although successful in localising faces and torsos of people, often fail with lower arms. Motion estimation is often inaccurate under fast movements of body parts. We build a segmentation-detection algorithm that mediates the information between body parts recognition, and multi-frame motion grouping to improve both pose detection and tracking. Motion of body parts, though not accurate, is often sufficient to segment them from their backgrounds. Such segmentations are crucialfor extracting hard to detect body parts out of their interior body clutter. By matching these segments to exemplars we obtain pose labeled body segments. The pose labeled segments and corresponding articulated joints are used to improve the motion flow fields by proposing kinematically constrained affine displacements on body parts. The pose-based articulated motion model is shown to handle large limb rotations and displacements. Our algorithm can detect people under rare poses, frequently missed by pose detectors, showing the benefits of jointly reasoning about pose, segmentation and motion in videos.</p><p>5 0.27194139 <a title="335-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Articulated_Pose_Estimation_Using_Discriminative_Armlet_Classifiers.html">45 cvpr-2013-Articulated Pose Estimation Using Discriminative Armlet Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgia Gkioxari, Pablo Arbeláez, Lubomir Bourdev, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for human pose estimation in real-world cluttered scenes, and focus on the challenging problem of predicting the pose of both arms for each person in the image. For this purpose, we build on the notion of poselets [4] and train highly discriminative classifiers to differentiate among arm configurations, which we call armlets. We propose a rich representation which, in addition to standardHOGfeatures, integrates the information of strong contours, skin color and contextual cues in a principled manner. Unlike existing methods, we evaluate our approach on a large subset of images from the PASCAL VOC detection dataset, where critical visual phenomena, such as occlusion, truncation, multiple instances and clutter are the norm. Our approach outperforms Yang and Ramanan [26], the state-of-the-art technique, with an improvement from 29.0% to 37.5% PCP accuracy on the arm keypoint prediction task, on this new pose estimation dataset.</p><p>6 0.25803125 <a title="335-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Human_Pose_Estimation_Using_a_Joint_Pixel-wise_and_Part-wise_Formulation.html">207 cvpr-2013-Human Pose Estimation Using a Joint Pixel-wise and Part-wise Formulation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kota Hara, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as bodyjoints is constructed and thepositions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node ’s position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes ’ positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted re- gression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.</p><p>6 0.79503268 <a title="335-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-MODEC%3A_Multimodal_Decomposable_Models_for_Human_Pose_Estimation.html">277 cvpr-2013-MODEC: Multimodal Decomposable Models for Human Pose Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ajay Kumar, Cyril Kwong</p><p>Abstract: In order to avail the benefits of higher user convenience, hygiene, and improved accuracy, contactless 3D fingerprint recognition techniques have recently been introduced. One of the key limitations of these emerging 3D fingerprint technologies to replace the conventional 2D fingerprint system is their bulk and high cost, which mainly results from the use of multiple imaging cameras or structured lighting employed in these systems. This paper details the development of a contactless 3D fingerprint identification system that uses only single camera. We develop a new representation of 3D finger surface features using Finger Surface Codes and illustrate its effectiveness in matching 3D fingerprints. Conventional minutiae representation is extended in 3D space to accurately match the recovered 3D minutiae. Multiple 2D fingerprint images (with varying illumination profile) acquired to build 3D fingerprints can themselves be used recover 2D features for further improving 3D fingerprint identification and has been illustrated in this paper. The experimental results are shown on a database of 240 client fingerprints and confirm the advantages of the single camera based 3D fingerprint identification.</p><p>2 0.86682117 <a title="335-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-HDR_Deghosting%3A_How_to_Deal_with_Saturation%3F.html">195 cvpr-2013-HDR Deghosting: How to Deal with Saturation?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Hu, Orazio Gallo, Kari Pulli, Xiaobai Sun</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for aligning images in an HDR (high-dynamic-range) image stack to produce a new exposure stack where all the images are aligned and appear as if they were taken simultaneously, even in the case of highly dynamic scenes. Our method produces plausible results even where the image used as a reference is either too dark or bright to allow for an accurate registration.</p><p>3 0.86380202 <a title="335-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Recovering_Stereo_Pairs_from_Anaglyphs.html">352 cvpr-2013-Recovering Stereo Pairs from Anaglyphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Armand Joulin, Sing Bing Kang</p><p>Abstract: An anaglyph is a single image created by selecting complementary colors from a stereo color pair; the user can perceive depth by viewing it through color-filtered glasses. We propose a technique to reconstruct the original color stereo pair given such an anaglyph. We modified SIFT-Flow and use it to initially match the different color channels across the two views. Our technique then iteratively refines the matches, selects the good matches (which defines the “anchor” colors), and propagates the anchor colors. We use a diffusion-based technique for the color propagation, and added a step to suppress unwanted colors. Results on a variety of inputs demonstrate the robustness of our technique. We also extended our method to anaglyph videos by using optic flow between time frames.</p><p>4 0.85757244 <a title="335-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Groupwise_Registration_via_Graph_Shrinkage_on_the_Image_Manifold.html">194 cvpr-2013-Groupwise Registration via Graph Shrinkage on the Image Manifold</a></p>
<p>Author: Shihui Ying, Guorong Wu, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen</p><p>Abstract: Recently, groupwise registration has been investigated for simultaneous alignment of all images without selecting any individual image as the template, thus avoiding the potential bias in image registration. However, none of current groupwise registration method fully utilizes the image distribution to guide the registration. Thus, the registration performance usually suffers from large inter-subject variations across individual images. To solve this issue, we propose a novel groupwise registration algorithm for large population dataset, guided by the image distribution on the manifold. Specifically, we first use a graph to model the distribution of all image data sitting on the image manifold, with each node representing an image and each edge representing the geodesic pathway between two nodes (or images). Then, the procedure of warping all images to theirpopulation center turns to the dynamic shrinking ofthe graph nodes along their graph edges until all graph nodes become close to each other. Thus, the topology ofimage distribution on the image manifold is always preserved during the groupwise registration. More importantly, by modeling , the distribution of all images via a graph, we can potentially reduce registration error since every time each image is warped only according to its nearby images with similar structures in the graph. We have evaluated our proposed groupwise registration method on both synthetic and real datasets, with comparison to the two state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. All experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of registration accuracy and robustness.</p><p>5 0.85626215 <a title="335-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Non-rigid_Structure_from_Motion_with_Diffusion_Maps_Prior.html">306 cvpr-2013-Non-rigid Structure from Motion with Diffusion Maps Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Lili Tao, Bogdan J. Matuszewski</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, a novel approach based on a non-linear manifold learning technique is proposed to recover 3D nonrigid structures from 2D image sequences captured by a single camera. Most ofthe existing approaches assume that 3D shapes can be accurately modelled in a linear subspace. These techniques perform well when the deformations are relatively small or simple, but fail when more complex deformations need to be recovered. The non-linear deformations are often observed in highly flexible objects for which the use of the linear model is impractical. A specific type of shape variations might be governed by only a small number of parameters, therefore can be wellrepresented in a low dimensional manifold. We learn a nonlinear shape prior using diffusion maps method. The key contribution in this paper is the introduction of the shape prior that constrain the reconstructed shapes to lie in the learned manifold. The proposed methodology has been validated quantitatively and qualitatively on 2D points sequences projected from the 3D motion capture data and real 2D video sequences. The comparisons oftheproposed man- ifold based method against several state-of-the-art techniques are shown on different types of deformable objects.</p><p>6 0.85087037 <a title="335-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Video_Editing_with_Temporal%2C_Spatial_and_Appearance_Consistency.html">453 cvpr-2013-Video Editing with Temporal, Spatial and Appearance Consistency</a></p>
