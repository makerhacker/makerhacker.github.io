viewing is all the MySQL scaling knowledge that was shared.Planet MySQLis a
great source of the goings on:Scaling out MySQL: Hardware today and tomorrowby
Jeremy Cole and Eric Bergen of Proven Scaling. In it are answered all the big
questions of life: What about 64-bit? How many cores? How much memory? Shared
storage? Finally we learn the secrets of true happiness.Panel Video: Scaling
MySQL? Up or Out?. Don't have time? Take a look at theDiamond Noteexcellent
game day summary. Companies like MySQL, Sun, Flickr, Fotolog, Wikipedia,
Facebook and YouTube share intel on how many web servers they have, how they
handle failure, and how they scale.Kevin Burton inScaling MySQL and Java in

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>6 0.85035324 <a title="586-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-18-Scaling_Mania_at_MySQL_Conference_2008.html">303 high scalability-2008-04-18-Scaling Mania at MySQL Conference 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the
Hitchhiker's Guid</p><p>5 0.66234499 <a title="586-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-13-Strategy%3A_Saving_Your_Butt_With_Deferred_Deletes.html">809 high scalability-2010-04-13-Strategy: Saving Your Butt With Deferred Deletes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deferred Deletesis a technique where deleted items are marked as deleted but
not garbage collected until some days or preferably weeks later. James
Hamilton talks describes this strategy in his classicOn Designing and
Deploying Internet-Scale Services:Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted.
When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two
week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or
administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause
on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical
copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against
this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference
between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For
those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data
coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, being
cautious, we re</p><p>6 0.5907526 <a title="586-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling_Traffic%3A_People_Pod_Pool_of_On_Demand_Self_Driving_Robotic_Cars_who_Automatically_Refuel_from_Cheap_Solar.html">657 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling Traffic: People Pod Pool of On Demand Self Driving Robotic Cars who Automatically Refuel from Cheap Solar</a></p>
