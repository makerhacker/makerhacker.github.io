<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their
website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the
Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth "Sid" Anand,Netflix's
Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems, gives a detailed look at this
transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing
especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a
RDBMS.Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would
appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please
comment here or email Sid atr39132@hotmail.com or Twitter at @r39132 Here's
the introduction from the paper:Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data
center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-
failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability - data center outages meant
interruptions to service and negative customer impact. Additionally, with
growth in both streaming</p><p>3 0.18713269 <a title="1180-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team.Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune
to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of supporting the
needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.In 2010, I helped Netflix to
successfullytransition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB, AWS'
hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second
migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key
to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our
expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions
-- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the
other in Ireland (F1). Both of these transitions have been successful, but
have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database
replication technology.In December 2011, I moved to LinkedIn's Distributed

<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible
120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a
distribution-aware design of DBMSs.The paper then introduces fundamental
concepts, techniques</p><p>3 0.74283415 <a title="1180-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...Adrian Cockcroft Compares NoSQL Availability
Models. Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into
the differences between the many NoSQL contenders. Adrian asks how each NoSQL
product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this
works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple
writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.Stuff the Internet Says:@jerng:
Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the
future.@freerangedata: The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of
data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them
all.@edward_ribeiro: Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL
systems. You know, only the fittest will survive.@connectionreq: I'm always

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team. Preamble RambleIf you've been working in the
online (e.g. internet) space over the past 3 years, you are no stranger to
terms like "the cloud" and "NoSQL".In 2007, Amazon published a paper onDynamo.
The paper detailed how Dynamo, employing a collection of techniques to solve
several problems in fault-tolerance, provided a resilient solution to the on-
line shopping cart problem. A few years go by while engineers at AWS toil in
relative obscurity at standing up their public cloud.It's December 2008 and I
am a member of Netflix's Software Infrastructure team. We've just been told
that there is something called the "CAP theorem" and because of it, we are to
abandon our datacenter in hopes of leveraging Cloud Computing.Huh?A month into
the investigation, we start wondering about our Oracle database. How are we
are going to move it into the cloud? That's when we are told that we are to

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,
won'</p><p>3 0.92389548 <a title="1180-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-02-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_2%2C_2010.html">851 high scalability-2010-07-02-Hot Scalability Links for July 2, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is
still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head
scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are
you still the same person?The Ise Grand Shrine has been in continuous
existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has
been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then
dismantled.Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a
living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what
is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the
shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that
imperative.You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects
like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed
in each new environment.The patterns of recurrence in software are the result
of Darwinian selectio</p><p>5 0.922391 <a title="1180-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-29-AWS_v_GCE_Face-off_and_Why_Innovation_Needs_Lower_Cost_Infrastructures.html">1448 high scalability-2013-04-29-AWS v GCE Face-off and Why Innovation Needs Lower Cost Infrastructures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and
GCE shares i</p><p>6 0.92237091 <a title="1180-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>
