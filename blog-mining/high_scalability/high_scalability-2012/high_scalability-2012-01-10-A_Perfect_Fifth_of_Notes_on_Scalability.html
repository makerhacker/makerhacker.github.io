<p>Introduction: I can't even count the number of times that I've heard this phrase: "don't
worry about scaling your web application, worry about visitor (or customer)
acquisition." My response to this is always that you don't need to choose one
or the other, you can do both! In this post, I'm going to go over some of the
strategies I've used to architect web applications for scalability, right from
the start of the design process, in such a way that I'm prepared to scale when
I need to, but not forced into doing so before its necessary. Easing the
transition from small scale to large scale can be made much easier by choosing
the right technologies and implementing the right coding patterns up front.You

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>3 0.72690284 <a title="1172-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-04-11_Strategies_to_Rock_Your_Startup%E2%80%99s_Scalability_in_2010.html">757 high scalability-2010-01-04-11 Strategies to Rock Your Startup’s Scalability in 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest posting by Marty Abbott and Michael Fisher, authors ofThe Art
of Scalability. I'm still reading their book and will have an interview with
them a little later.  If 2010 is the year that you've decided to kickoff your
startup or if you've already got something off the ground and are expecting
double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all
wanttheattentionof usersto achieve viral growth but as manycan attest, too
much attention can bring a startup to its knees. If you've used Twitter for
any amount of time you're sure to have seen the "Fail Whale", which is so
often seen that it has its ownfan club. Take a look at the graph below from
Compete.com showing Twitter's unique visitors. One can argue that limitations
in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growthover
the past six monthsas does the availability,butit's hard to believe the
inability of users to actually use the service has not hindered growth. What

<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of service oriented
architectures as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. InSecurity
Now 385, that Doyen of Disk,Steve Gibson, tells the fascinating story (@ about
41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives,
modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high
density disk drives we enjoy today.When drives switched to use
theIDE(integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved
into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals
moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for
the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.This allowed manufacturers
to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped
being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky
rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals
could completely change as</p><p>5 0.7092945 <a title="1172-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>

by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software

of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,

per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak time of normal

<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set ofNotes on Scalability, just in case you
do reach your wildest expectations of success:Build it to Break. Plan for the
fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are
independent and redundant.Everything is a Feature. Your application is a set
of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering
trade-offs. Scale Out, Not Up. Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding
and managing horizontal resources. Buy More Storage. Large numbers of smaller,
faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives.You're Going to Do It
Wrong. Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be
prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.Please read
theoriginal articlefor a much more expansive treatment.</p><p>2 0.87022865 <a title="1172-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy%3A_Cache_Application_Start_State_to_Reduce_Spin-up_Times.html">1023 high scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy: Cache Application Start State to Reduce Spin-up Times</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Using this strategy, Valyala, a commenter onAre Long VM Instance Spin-Up Times
In The Cloud Costing You Money?, was able to reduce their GAE application
start-up times from 15 seconds down to to 1.5 seconds:Spin-up time for newly
added Google AppEngine instances can be reduced using initial state caching.
Usually the majority of spin-up time for the newly created GAE instance is
spent in the pre-populating of the initial state, which is created from many
data pieces loaded from slow data sources such as GAE's datastore. If the
initial state is identical among GAE instances, then the entire state can be
serialized and stored in a shared memory (either in the memcache or in the
datastore) by the first created instance, so newly created instances could
load and quickly unserialize the state from a single blob loaded from shared
memory instead of spending a lot of time for creation of the state from
multiple data pieces loaded from the datastore.I reduced spin-up time for new
instances of</p><p>3 0.84444553 <a title="1172-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_22%2C_2011.html">1084 high scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 22, 2011</a></p>

about 1 million e-transactions in a day. $30M worth of multi-gig downloads
that must work.@lmacvittie- Cloud has shifted the focus of scalability from
applications to architecture.@bartbohn- Love the phrase "anarchic scalability"
by Roy Fielding@iAjayMe- Programming: I have come to the conclusion, if you
want to do something right the first time (scalability,performance) write it
in C++@mreferre- Interesting discussion between @jamesurquhart and @lmacvittie
about PaaS/App scalability (I think). Need google translator

<p>Introduction: Discois an open-source implementation of the MapReduce framework for
distributed computing. It was started atNokia Research Centeras a lightweight
framework for rapid scripting of distributed data processing tasks. The Disco
core is written in Erlang. The MapReduce jobs in Disco are natively described
as Python programs, which makes it possible to express complex algorithmic and
data processing tasks often only in tens of lines of code.</p><p>5 0.82850921 <a title="1172-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com.html">177 high scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com</a></p>
