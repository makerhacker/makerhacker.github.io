<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called"NewSQL". On the
definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:"NewSQL" is our shorthand for the various
new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously
referred to these products as 'ScalableSQL' to differentiate them from the
incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal
scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we
adopted the term 'NewSQL' in the new report.And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL
is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is
the vendor, not the SQL.As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see
various providers, with various solutions.I think these can be divided into
several sub-types:New MySQL storage engines. These give MySQL users the same
programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this
field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it's not
supporting other databa</p><p>2 0.9393487 <a title="303-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-06-BankSimple_Mini-Architecture_-_Using_a_Next_Generation_Toolchain.html">970 high scalability-2011-01-06-BankSimple Mini-Architecture - Using a Next Generation Toolchain</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know people are always interested in what others are using to build their
systems.Alex Payne, CTO of the new startupBankSimple, gives us a quick hit on
their toolchain choices in this Quora thread. BankSimple positions itself as a
customer-focused alternative to online banking. You may remember Alex from
theearly days of Twitter. Alex was always helpful to me on Twitter's
programmer support list, so I really wish them well. Alex is also a bit of an
outside the box thinker, which is reflected in some of their choices:The JVM
acts as a convergence platform for these languages:Scala- ideal for writing
performance-sensitive components that need the safety and expressiveness of
the language's advanced type system.Clojure- rapidly prototype in a more
dynamic language while still offering the benefits of functional
programming.JRuby- makes available a bunch of great libraries and frameworks
for doing frontend web development, like Rails and Padrino.Frontend: MooTools
on the JavaScript side.</p><p>3 0.93727916 <a title="303-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-04-Manage_Downtime_Risk_by_Connecting_Multiple_Data_Centers_into_a_Secure_Virtual_LAN.html">266 high scalability-2008-03-04-Manage Downtime Risk by Connecting Multiple Data Centers into a Secure Virtual LAN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP
tunnel between different data centers over public internet links so your
application sees a flat virtual</p><p>4 0.93194205 <a title="303-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-22-How_can_we_spark_the_movement_of_research_out_of_the_Ivory_Tower_and_into_production%3F.html">863 high scalability-2010-07-22-How can we spark the movement of research out of the Ivory Tower and into production?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed
