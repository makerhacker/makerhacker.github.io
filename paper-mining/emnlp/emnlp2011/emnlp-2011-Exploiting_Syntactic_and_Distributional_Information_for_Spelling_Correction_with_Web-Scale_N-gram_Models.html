<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>3 0.10326605 <a title="55-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Discovering_Morphological_Paradigms_from_Plain_Text_Using_a_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Model.html">39 emnlp-2011-Discovering Morphological Paradigms from Plain Text Using a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Markus Dreyer ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: We present an inference algorithm that organizes observed words (tokens) into structured inflectional paradigms (types). It also naturally predicts the spelling of unobserved forms that are missing from these paradigms, and discovers inflectional principles (grammar) that generalize to wholly unobserved words. Our Bayesian generative model of the data explicitly represents tokens, types, inflections, paradigms, and locally conditioned string edits. It assumes that inflected word tokens are generated from an infinite mixture of inflectional paradigms (string tuples). Each paradigm is sampled all at once from a graphical model, whose potential functions are weighted finitestate transducers with language-specific parameters to be learned. These assumptions naturally lead to an elegant empirical Bayes inference procedure that exploits Monte Carlo EM, belief propagation, and dynamic programming. Given 50–100 seed paradigms, adding a 10million-word corpus reduces prediction error for morphological inflections by up to 10%.</p><p>4 0.096022248 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Semantic_Topic_Models%3A_Combining_Word_Distributional_Statistics_and_Dictionary_Definitions.html">119 emnlp-2011-Semantic Topic Models: Combining Word Distributional Statistics and Dictionary Definitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel topic model based on incorporating dictionary definitions. Traditional topic models treat words as surface strings without assuming predefined knowledge about word meaning. They infer topics only by observing surface word co-occurrence. However, the co-occurred words may not be semantically related in a manner that is relevant for topic coherence. Exploiting dictionary definitions explicitly in our model yields a better understanding of word semantics leading to better text modeling. We exploit WordNet as a lexical resource for sense definitions. We show that explicitly modeling word definitions helps improve performance significantly over the baseline for a text categorization task.</p><p>5 0.087161638 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous_Phrase_Dependency_Grammars_for_Machine_Translation.html">108 emnlp-2011-Quasi-Synchronous Phrase Dependency Grammars for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Gimpel ; Noah A.

This formulation allows us to combine structural components of phrase-based and syntax-based MT in a single model. We describe a method of extracting phrase dependencies from parallel text using a target-side dependency parser. For decoding, we describe a coarse-to-fine approach based on lattice dependency parsing of phrase lattices. We demonstrate performance improvements for Chinese-English and UrduEnglish translation over a phrase-based baseline.

<p>Author: Sze-Meng Jojo Wong ; Mark Dras</p><p>Abstract: Attempts to profile authors according to their characteristics extracted from textual data, including native language, have drawn attention in recent years, via various machine learning approaches utilising mostly lexical features. Drawing on the idea of contrastive analysis, which postulates that syntactic errors in a text are to some extent influenced by the native language of an author, this paper explores the usefulness of syntactic features for native language identification. We take two types of parse substructure as features— horizontal slices of trees, and the more general feature schemas from discriminative parse reranking—and show that using this kind of syntactic feature results in an accuracy score in classification of seven native languages of around 80%, an error reduction of more than 30%.</p><p>4 0.34933552 <a title="55-lsi-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Discovering_Morphological_Paradigms_from_Plain_Text_Using_a_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Model.html">39 emnlp-2011-Discovering Morphological Paradigms from Plain Text Using a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Dani Yogatama ; Michael Heilman ; Brendan O'Connor ; Chris Dyer ; Bryan R. Routledge ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting measurable responses to scientific articles based primarily on their text content. Specifically, we consider papers in two fields (economics and computational linguistics) and make predictions about downloads and within-community citations. Our approach is based on generalized linear models, allowing interpretability; a novel extension that captures first-order temporal effects is also presented. We demonstrate that text features significantly improve accuracy of predictions over metadata features like authors, topical categories, and publication venues.</p><p>6 0.32380974 <a title="55-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Parse_Correction_with_Specialized_Models_for_Difficult_Attachment_Types.html">102 emnlp-2011-Parse Correction with Specialized Models for Difficult Attachment Types</a></p>

<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>4 0.57918727 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21%21_Using_Word_Lengthening_to_Detect_Sentiment_in_Microblogs.html">33 emnlp-2011-Cooooooooooooooollllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Using Word Lengthening to Detect Sentiment in Microblogs</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Brody ; Nicholas Diakopoulos</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic method which leverages word lengthening to adapt a sentiment lexicon specifically for Twitter and similar social messaging networks. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, we call attention to lengthening as a widespread phenomenon in microblogs and social messaging, and demonstrate the importance of handling it correctly. We then show that lengthening is strongly associated with subjectivity and sentiment. Finally, we present an automatic method which leverages this association to detect domain-specific sentiment- and emotionbearing words. We evaluate our method by comparison to human judgments, and analyze its strengths and weaknesses. Our results are of interest to anyone analyzing sentiment in microblogs and social networks, whether for research or commercial purposes.</p><p>5 0.57761258 <a title="55-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>6 0.5761109 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Data-Driven_Response_Generation_in_Social_Media.html">38 emnlp-2011-Data-Driven Response Generation in Social Media</a></p>
