<p>Author: Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, David Murray, Ian Reid</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic framework for simultaneous tracking and reconstruction of 3D rigid objects using an RGB-D camera. The tracking problem is handled using a bag-of-pixels representation and a back-projection scheme. Surface and background appearance models are learned online, leading to robust tracking in the presence of heavy occlusion and outliers. In both our tracking and reconstruction modules, the 3D object is implicitly embedded using a 3D level-set function. The framework is initialized with a simple shape primitive model (e.g. a sphere or a cube), and the real 3D object shape is tracked and reconstructed online. Unlike existing depth-based 3D reconstruction works, which either rely on calibrated/fixed camera set up or use the observed world map to track the depth camera, our framework can simultaneously track and reconstruct small moving objects. We use both qualitative and quantitative results to demonstrate the superior performance of both tracking and reconstruction of our method.</p><p>3 0.18876329 <a title="139-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>4 0.16427615 <a title="139-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Point-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects.html">319 iccv-2013-Point-Based 3D Reconstruction of Thin Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Ummenhofer, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction deals with the problem of finding the shape of an object from a set of images. Thin objects that have virtually no volumepose a special challengefor reconstruction with respect to shape representation and fusion of depth information. In this paper we present a dense pointbased reconstruction method that can deal with this special class of objects. We seek to jointly optimize a set of depth maps by treating each pixel as a point in space. Points are pulled towards a common surface by pairwise forces in an iterative scheme. The method also handles the problem of opposed surfaces by means of penalty forces. Efficient optimization is achieved by grouping points to superpixels and a spatial hashing approach for fast neighborhood queries. We show that the approach is on a par with state-of-the-art methods for standard multi view stereo settings and gives superior results for thin objects.</p><p>5 0.16083951 <a title="139-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Flexible_Scene_Representation_for_3D_Reconstruction_Using_an_RGB-D_Camera.html">9 iccv-2013-A Flexible Scene Representation for 3D Reconstruction Using an RGB-D Camera</a></p>
<p>Author: Diego Thomas, Akihiro Sugimoto</p><p>Abstract: Updating a global 3D model with live RGB-D measurements has proven to be successful for 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. Recently, a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) volumetric model and a fusion algorithm have been introduced (KinectFusion), showing significant advantages such as computational speed and accuracy of the reconstructed scene. This algorithm, however, is expensive in memory when constructing and updating the global model. As a consequence, the method is not well scalable to large scenes. We propose a new flexible 3D scene representation using a set of planes that is cheap in memory use and, nevertheless, achieves accurate reconstruction of indoor scenes from RGB-D image sequences. Projecting the scene onto different planes reduces significantly the size of the scene representation and thus it allows us to generate a global textured 3D model with lower memory requirement while keeping accuracy and easiness to update with live RGB-D measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed flexible 3D scene representation achieves accurate reconstruction, while keeping the scalability for large indoor scenes.</p><p>6 0.15551567 <a title="139-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>

<p>Author: Che-Han Chang, Min-Chun Hu, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yung-Yu Chuang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new projection model for mapping a hemisphere to a plane. Such a model can be useful for viewing wide-angle images. Our model consists of two steps. In the first step, the hemisphere is projected onto a swung surface constructed by a circular profile and a rounded rectangular trajectory. The second step maps the projected image on the swung surface onto the image plane through the perspective projection. We also propose a method for automatically determining proper parameters for the projection model based on image content. The proposed model has several advantages. It is simple, efficient and easy to control. Most importantly, it makes a better compromise between distortion minimization and line preserving than popular projection models, such as stereographic and Pannini projections. Experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</p><p>5 0.73035604 <a title="139-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_Flexible_Scene_Representation_for_3D_Reconstruction_Using_an_RGB-D_Camera.html">9 iccv-2013-A Flexible Scene Representation for 3D Reconstruction Using an RGB-D Camera</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Martin, Vincent Couture, Sébastien Roy</p><p>Abstract: We present a scanning method that recovers dense subpixel camera-projector correspondence without requiring any photometric calibration nor preliminary knowledge of their relative geometry. Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns. We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities. Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision, and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems. We compare our results to state of the art methods such as micro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting.</p><p>3 0.66368985 <a title="139-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Elastic_Net_Constraints_for_Shape_Matching.html">140 iccv-2013-Elastic Net Constraints for Shape Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuele Rodolà, Andrea Torsello, Tatsuya Harada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We consider a parametrized relaxation of the widely adopted quadratic assignment problem (QAP) formulation for minimum distortion correspondence between deformable shapes. In order to control the accuracy/sparsity trade-off we introduce a weighting parameter on the combination of two existing relaxations, namely spectral and game-theoretic. This leads to the introduction of the elastic net penalty function into shape matching problems. In combination with an efficient algorithm to project onto the elastic net ball, we obtain an approach for deformable shape matching with controllable sparsity. Experiments on a standard benchmark confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>4 0.6619429 <a title="139-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Shape_Index_Descriptors_Applied_to_Texture-Based_Galaxy_Analysis.html">388 iccv-2013-Shape Index Descriptors Applied to Texture-Based Galaxy Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kim Steenstrup Pedersen, Kristoffer Stensbo-Smidt, Andrew Zirm, Christian Igel</p><p>Abstract: A texture descriptor based on the shape index and the accompanying curvedness measure is proposed, and it is evaluated for the automated analysis of astronomical image data. A representative sample of images of low-redshift galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) serves as a testbed. The goal of applying texture descriptors to these data is to extract novel information about galaxies; information which is often lost in more traditional analysis. In this study, we build a regression model for predicting a spectroscopic quantity, the specific star-formation rate (sSFR). As texture features we consider multi-scale gradient orientation histograms as well as multi-scale shape index histograms, which lead to a new descriptor. Our results show that we can successfully predict spectroscopic quantities from the texture in optical multi-band images. We successfully recover the observed bi-modal distribution of galaxies into quiescent and star-forming. The state-ofthe-art for predicting the sSFR is a color-based physical model. We significantly improve its accuracy by augmenting the model with texture information. This study is thefirst step towards enabling the quantification of physical galaxy properties from imaging data alone.</p><p>5 0.65637058 <a title="139-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>6 0.6553871 <a title="139-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Adapting_Classification_Cascades_to_New_Domains.html">44 iccv-2013-Adapting Classification Cascades to New Domains</a></p>
