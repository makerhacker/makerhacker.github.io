<p>Author: Reyyan Yeniterzi ; Kemal Oflazer</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel scheme to apply factored phrase-based SMT to a language pair with very disparate morphological structures. Our approach relies on syntactic analysis on the source side (English) and then encodes a wide variety of local and non-local syntactic structures as complex structural tags which appear as additional factors in the training data. On the target side (Turkish), we only perform morphological analysis and disambiguation but treat the complete complex morphological tag as a factor, instead of separating morphemes. We incrementally explore capturing various syntactic substructures as complex tags on the English side, and evaluate how our translations improve in BLEU scores. Our maximal set of source and target side transformations, coupled with some additional techniques, provide an 39% relative improvement from a baseline 17.08 to 23.78 BLEU, all averaged over 10 training and test sets. Now that the syntactic analysis on the English side is available, we also experiment with more long distance constituent reordering to bring the English constituent order close to Turkish, but find that these transformations do not provide any additional consistent tangible gains when averaged over the 10 sets.</p><p>3 0.1133307 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Search_for_the_Optimal_Segmentation_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">249 acl-2010-Unsupervised Search for the Optimal Segmentation for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Coskun Mermer ; Ahmet Afsin Akin</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the previously unaddressed problem of unsupervised determination of the optimal morphological segmentation for statistical machine translation (SMT) and propose a segmentation metric that takes into account both sides of the SMT training corpus. We formulate the objective function as the posterior probability of the training corpus according to a generative segmentation-translation model. We describe how the IBM Model-1 translation likelihood can be computed incrementally between adjacent segmentation states for efficient computation. Submerging the proposed segmentation method in a SMT task from morphologically-rich Turkish to English does not exhibit the expected improvement in translation BLEU scores and confirms the robustness of phrase-based SMT to translation unit combinatorics. A positive outcome of this work is the described modification to the sequential search algorithm of Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) that enables arbitrary-fold parallelization of the computation, which unexpectedly improves the translation performance as measured by BLEU.</p><p>4 0.075668633 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2010-The_Use_of_Formal_Language_Models_in_the_Typology_of_the_Morphology_of_Amerindian_Languages.html">234 acl-2010-The Use of Formal Language Models in the Typology of the Morphology of Amerindian Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Andres Osvaldo Porta</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to present some preliminary results of an investigation in course on the typology of the morphology of the native South American languages from the point of view of the formal language theory. With this object, we give two contrasting examples of descriptions of two Aboriginal languages finite verb forms morphology: Argentinean Quechua (quichua santiague n˜o) and Toba. The description of the morphology of the finite verb forms of Argentinean quechua, uses finite automata and finite transducers. In this case the construction is straightforward using two level morphology and then, describes in a very natural way the Argentinean Quechua morphology using a regular language. On the contrary, the Toba verbs morphology, with a system that simultaneously uses prefixes and suffixes, has not a natural description as regular language. Toba has a complex system of causative suffixes, whose successive applications determinate the use of prefixes belonging different person marking prefix sets. We adopt the solution of Creider et al. (1995) to naturally deal with this and other similar morphological processes which involve interactions between prefixes and suffixes and then we describe the toba morphology using linear context-free languages.1 .</p><p>5 0.070898093 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2010-A_Statistical_Model_for_Lost_Language_Decipherment.html">16 acl-2010-A Statistical Model for Lost Language Decipherment</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Snyder ; Regina Barzilay ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a method for the automatic decipherment of lost languages. Given a non-parallel corpus in a known related language, our model produces both alphabetic mappings and translations of words into their corresponding cognates. We employ a non-parametric Bayesian framework to simultaneously capture both low-level character mappings and highlevel morphemic correspondences. This formulation enables us to encode some of the linguistic intuitions that have guided human decipherers. When applied to the ancient Semitic language Ugaritic, the model correctly maps 29 of 30 letters to their Hebrew counterparts, and deduces the correct Hebrew cognate for 60% of the Ugaritic words which have cognates in Hebrew.</p><p>6 0.063134015 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-Sparsity_in_Dependency_Grammar_Induction.html">214 acl-2010-Sparsity in Dependency Grammar Induction</a></p>

<p>Author: Vipul Mittal</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic segmentation of a Sanskrit string into different words. The input for our segmentizer is a Sanskrit string either encoded as a Unicode string or as a Roman transliterated string and the output is a set of possible splits with weights associated with each of them. We followed two different approaches to segment a Sanskrit text using sandhi1 rules extracted from a parallel corpus of manually sandhi split text. While the first approach augments the finite state transducer used to analyze Sanskrit morphology and traverse it to segment a word, the second approach generates all possible segmentations and validates each constituent using a morph an- alyzer.</p><p>4 0.65173537 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="./acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology_Mapping_in_Factored_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation_from_English_to_Turkish.html">221 acl-2010-Syntax-to-Morphology Mapping in Factored Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation from English to Turkish</a></p>

In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy of relations that integrates previous relations, the largest publicly-available annotated dataset, and a supervised classification method for automatic noun compound interpretation.</p><p>3 0.61628997 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Automated_Planning_for_Situated_Natural_Language_Generation.html">35 acl-2010-Automated Planning for Situated Natural Language Generation</a></p>
<p>Author: Konstantina Garoufi ; Alexander Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a natural language generation approach which models, exploits, and manipulates the non-linguistic context in situated communication, using techniques from AI planning. We show how to generate instructions which deliberately guide the hearer to a location that is convenient for the generation of simple referring expressions, and how to generate referring expressions with context-dependent adjectives. We implement and evaluate our approach in the framework of the Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments, finding that it performs well even under the constraints of realtime generation.</p><p>4 0.60367566 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./acl-2010-Unsupervised_Ontology_Induction_from_Text.html">248 acl-2010-Unsupervised Ontology Induction from Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Hoifung Poon ; Pedro Domingos</p><p>Abstract: Extracting knowledge from unstructured text is a long-standing goal of NLP. Although learning approaches to many of its subtasks have been developed (e.g., parsing, taxonomy induction, information extraction), all end-to-end solutions to date require heavy supervision and/or manual engineering, limiting their scope and scalability. We present OntoUSP, a system that induces and populates a probabilistic ontology using only dependency-parsed text as input. OntoUSP builds on the USP unsupervised semantic parser by jointly forming ISA and IS-PART hierarchies of lambda-form clusters. The ISA hierarchy allows more general knowledge to be learned, and the use of smoothing for parameter estimation. We evaluate On- toUSP by using it to extract a knowledge base from biomedical abstracts and answer questions. OntoUSP improves on the recall of USP by 47% and greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p><p>5 0.56622773 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Event-Based_Hyperspace_Analogue_to_Language_for_Query_Expansion.html">106 acl-2010-Event-Based Hyperspace Analogue to Language for Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Tingxu Yan ; Tamsin Maxwell ; Dawei Song ; Yuexian Hou ; Peng Zhang</p><p>Abstract: p . zhang1 @ rgu .ac .uk Bag-of-words approaches to information retrieval (IR) are effective but assume independence between words. The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) is a cognitively motivated and validated semantic space model that captures statistical dependencies between words by considering their co-occurrences in a surrounding window of text. HAL has been successfully applied to query expansion in IR, but has several limitations, including high processing cost and use of distributional statistics that do not exploit syntax. In this paper, we pursue two methods for incorporating syntactic-semantic information from textual ‘events’ into HAL. We build the HAL space directly from events to investigate whether processing costs can be reduced through more careful definition of word co-occurrence, and improve the quality of the pseudo-relevance feedback by applying event information as a constraint during HAL construction. Both methods significantly improve performance results in comparison with original HAL, and interpolation of HAL and relevance model expansion outperforms either method alone.</p><p>6 0.48700806 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Sparsity_in_Dependency_Grammar_Induction.html">214 acl-2010-Sparsity in Dependency Grammar Induction</a></p>
