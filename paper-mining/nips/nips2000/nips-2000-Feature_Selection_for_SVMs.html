<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.15714952 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We present an improvement of Novikoff's perceptron convergence theorem. Reinterpreting this mistake bound as a margin dependent sparsity guarantee allows us to give a PAC-style generalisation error bound for the classifier learned by the perceptron learning algorithm. The bound value crucially depends on the margin a support vector machine would achieve on the same data set using the same kernel. Ironically, the bound yields better guarantees than are currently available for the support vector solution itself. 1</p><p>4 0.15349826 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Text_Classification_using_String_Kernels.html">130 nips-2000-Text Classification using String Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Huma Lodhi, John Shawe-Taylor, Nello Cristianini, Christopher J. C. H. Watkins</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel kernel for comparing two text documents. The kernel is an inner product in the feature space consisting of all subsequences of length k. A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results. 1</p><p>5 0.14292796 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-The_Kernel_Trick_for_Distances.html">134 nips-2000-The Kernel Trick for Distances</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: A method is described which, like the kernel trick in support vector machines (SVMs), lets us generalize distance-based algorithms to operate in feature spaces, usually nonlinearly related to the input space. This is done by identifying a class of kernels which can be represented as norm-based distances in Hilbert spaces. It turns out that common kernel algorithms, such as SVMs and kernel PCA, are actually really distance based algorithms and can be run with that class of kernels, too. As well as providing a useful new insight into how these algorithms work, the present work can form the basis for conceiving new algorithms.</p><p>6 0.13948528 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-A_Linear_Programming_Approach_to_Novelty_Detection.html">4 nips-2000-A Linear Programming Approach to Novelty Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Mika, Gunnar R채tsch, Klaus-Robert M체ller</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a new kernel-based classifier: the Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD). A mathematical programming formulation based on the observation that KFD maximizes the average margin permits an interesting modification of the original KFD algorithm yielding the sparse KFD. We find that both, KFD and the proposed sparse KFD, can be understood in an unifying probabilistic context. Furthermore, we show connections to Support Vector Machines and Relevance Vector Machines. From this understanding, we are able to outline an interesting kernel-regression technique based upon the KFD algorithm. Simulations support the usefulness of our approach.</p><p>4 0.57522196 <a title="54-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-A_PAC-Bayesian_Margin_Bound_for_Linear_Classifiers%3A_Why_SVMs_work.html">9 nips-2000-A PAC-Bayesian Margin Bound for Linear Classifiers: Why SVMs work</a></p>

In fact, there are counterexamples showing that the adjustable weights in some algorithms may oscillate within a region rather than converging to a point. This paper shows that, for two popular algorithms, such oscillation is the worst that can happen: the weights cannot diverge, but instead must converge to a bounded region. The algorithms are SARSA(O) and V(O); the latter algorithm was used in the well-known TD-Gammon program. 1</p><p>6 0.5135864 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-A_PAC-Bayesian_Margin_Bound_for_Linear_Classifiers%3A_Why_SVMs_work.html">9 nips-2000-A PAC-Bayesian Margin Bound for Linear Classifiers: Why SVMs work</a></p>
