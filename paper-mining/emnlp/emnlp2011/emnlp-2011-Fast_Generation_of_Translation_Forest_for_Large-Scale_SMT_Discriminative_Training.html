In our framework, we define two kinds of generative model for reranking. One is learned from training data offline and the other from a forest generated by a baseline parser on the fly.

<p>Author: Wei Lu ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel probabilistic approach for generating natural language sentences from their underlying semantics in the form of typed lambda calculus. The approach is built on top of a novel reduction-based weighted synchronous context free grammar formalism, which facilitates the transformation process from typed lambda calculus into natural language sentences. Sentences can then be generated based on such grammar rules with a log-linear model. To acquire such grammar rules automatically in an unsupervised manner, we also propose a novel approach with a generative model, which maps from sub-expressions of logical forms to word sequences in natural language sentences. Experiments on benchmark datasets for both English and Chinese generation tasks yield significant improvements over results obtained by two state-of-the-art machine translation models, in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation.</p><p>4 0.21762107 <a title="58-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-A_novel_dependency-to-string_model_for_statistical_machine_translation.html">15 emnlp-2011-A novel dependency-to-string model for statistical machine translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Xie ; Haitao Mi ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Dependency structure, as a first step towards semantics, is believed to be helpful to improve translation quality. However, previous works on dependency structure based models typically resort to insertion operations to complete translations, which make it difficult to specify ordering information in translation rules. In our model of this paper, we handle this problem by directly specifying the ordering information in head-dependents rules which represent the source side as head-dependents relations and the target side as strings. The head-dependents rules require only substitution operation, thus our model requires no heuristics or separate ordering models of the previous works to control the word order of translations. Large-scale experiments show that our model performs well on long distance reordering, and outperforms the state- of-the-art constituency-to-string model (+1.47 BLEU on average) and hierarchical phrasebased model (+0.46 BLEU on average) on two Chinese-English NIST test sets without resort to phrases or parse forest. For the first time, a source dependency structure based model catches up with and surpasses the state-of-theart translation models.</p><p>5 0.20950897 <a title="58-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Augmenting_String-to-Tree_Translation_Models_with_Fuzzy_Use_of_Source-side_Syntax.html">20 emnlp-2011-Augmenting String-to-Tree Translation Models with Fuzzy Use of Source-side Syntax</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Feifei Zhai ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Due to its explicit modeling of the grammaticality of the output via target-side syntax, the string-to-tree model has been shown to be one of the most successful syntax-based translation models. However, a major limitation of this model is that it does not utilize any useful syntactic information on the source side. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties of incorporating source syntax in a string-totree model. We then propose a new way to use the source syntax in a fuzzy manner, both in source syntactic annotation and in rule matching. We further explore three algorithms in rule matching: 0-1 matching, likelihood matching, and deep similarity matching. Our method not only guarantees grammatical output with an explicit target tree, but also enables the system to choose the proper translation rules via fuzzy use of the source syntax. Our extensive experiments have shown significant improvements over the state-of-the-art string-to-tree system. 1</p><p>6 0.16860563 <a title="58-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Syntactic_Decision_Tree_LMs%3A_Random_Selection_or_Intelligent_Design%3F.html">131 emnlp-2011-Syntactic Decision Tree LMs: Random Selection or Intelligent Design?</a></p>

<p>Author: Amal Al-Saif ; Katja Markert</p><p>Abstract: We present the first algorithms to automatically identify explicit discourse connectives and the relations they signal for Arabic text. First we show that, for Arabic news, most adjacent sentences are connected via explicit connectives in contrast to English, making the treatment of explicit discourse connectives for Arabic highly important. We also show that explicit Arabic discourse connectives are far more ambiguous than English ones, making their treatment challenging. In the second part of the paper, we present supervised algorithms to address automatic discourse connective identification and discourse relation recognition. Our connective identifier based on gold standard syntactic features achieves almost human performance. In addition, an identifier based solely on simple lexical and automatically derived morphological and POS features performs with high reliability, essential for languages that do not have high-quality parsers yet. Our algorithm for recognizing discourse relations performs significantly better than a baseline based on the connective surface string alone and therefore reduces the ambiguity in explicit connective interpretation.</p><p>3 0.86797416 <a title="58-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Third-order_Variational_Reranking_on_Packed-Shared_Dependency_Forests.html">134 emnlp-2011-Third-order Variational Reranking on Packed-Shared Dependency Forests</a></p>

The final prediction in the reranking stage is performed using linear interpolation of these models and discriminative model. In order to efficiently train the model from and decode on a hypergraph data structure representing a forest, we apply extended inside/outside and Viterbi algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed forest reranking algorithm achieves significant improvement when compared with conventional approaches.</p><p>4 0.86264908 <a title="58-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Statistical_Machine_Translation_with_Local_Language_Models.html">125 emnlp-2011-Statistical Machine Translation with Local Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Christof Monz</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech language modeling is commonly used as a component in statistical machine translation systems, but there is mixed evidence that its usage leads to significant improvements. We argue that its limited effectiveness is due to the lack of lexicalization. We introduce a new approach that builds a separate local language model for each word and part-of-speech pair. The resulting models lead to more context-sensitive probability distributions and we also exploit the fact that different local models are used to estimate the language model probability of each word during decoding. Our approach is evaluated for Arabic- and Chinese-to-English translation. We show that it leads to statistically significant improvements for multiple test sets and also across different genres, when compared against a competitive baseline and a system using a part-of-speech model.</p><p>5 0.86009073 <a title="58-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Simple_Word_Trigger_Method_for_Social_Tag_Suggestion.html">11 emnlp-2011-A Simple Word Trigger Method for Social Tag Suggestion</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyuan Liu ; Xinxiong Chen ; Maosong Sun</p><p>Abstract: It is popular for users in Web 2.0 era to freely annotate online resources with tags. To ease the annotation process, it has been great interest in automatic tag suggestion. We propose a method to suggest tags according to the text description of a resource. By considering both the description and tags of a given resource as summaries to the resource written in two languages, we adopt word alignment models in statistical machine translation to bridge their vocabulary gap. Based on the translation probabilities between the words in descriptions and the tags estimated on a large set of description-tags pairs, we build a word trigger method (WTM) to suggest tags according to the words in a resource description. Experiments on real world datasets show that WTM is effective and robust compared with other methods. Moreover, WTM is relatively simple and efficient, which is practical for Web applications.</p><p>6 0.85882831 <a title="58-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Discourse_Relations_for_Eliminating_Intra-sentence_Polarity_Ambiguities.html">142 emnlp-2011-Unsupervised Discovery of Discourse Relations for Eliminating Intra-sentence Polarity Ambiguities</a></p>
