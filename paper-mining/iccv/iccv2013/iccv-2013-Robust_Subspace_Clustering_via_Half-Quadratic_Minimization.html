<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jinhui Tang, Min Lin, Liang Lin, Shuicheng Yan, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the robust subspace clustering problem, which aims to cluster the given possibly noisy data points into their underlying subspaces. A large pool of previous subspace clustering methods focus on the graph construction by different regularization of the representation coefficient. We instead focus on the robustness of the model to non-Gaussian noises. We propose a new robust clustering method by using the correntropy induced metric, which is robust for handling the non-Gaussian and impulsive noises. Also we further extend the method for handling the data with outlier rows/features. The multiplicative form of half-quadratic optimization is used to optimize the nonconvex correntropy objective function of the proposed models. Extensive experiments on face datasets well demonstrate that the proposed methods are more robust to corruptions and occlusions.</p><p>3 0.32048833 <a title="360-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Latent_Space_Sparse_Subspace_Clustering.html">232 iccv-2013-Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Vishal M. Patel, Hien Van Nguyen, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm called Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of data lying in a union of subspaces. Specifically, we describe a method that learns the projection of data and finds the sparse coefficients in the low-dimensional latent space. Cluster labels are then assigned by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix built from these sparse coefficients. An efficient optimization method is proposed and its non-linear extensions based on the kernel methods are presented. One of the main advantages of our method is that it is computationally efficient as the sparse coefficients are found in the low-dimensional latent space. Various experiments show that the proposed method performs better than the competitive state-of-theart subspace clustering methods.</p><p>4 0.26357234 <a title="360-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Perspective_Motion_Segmentation_via_Collaborative_Clustering.html">314 iccv-2013-Perspective Motion Segmentation via Collaborative Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuwen Li, Jiaming Guo, Loong-Fah Cheong, Steven Zhiying Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses real-world challenges in the motion segmentation problem, including perspective effects, missing data, and unknown number of motions. It first formulates the 3-D motion segmentation from two perspective views as a subspace clustering problem, utilizing the epipolar constraint of an image pair. It then combines the point correspondence information across multiple image frames via a collaborative clustering step, in which tight integration is achieved via a mixed norm optimization scheme. For model selection, wepropose an over-segment and merge approach, where the merging step is based on the property of the ?1-norm ofthe mutual sparse representation oftwo oversegmented groups. The resulting algorithm can deal with incomplete trajectories and perspective effects substantially better than state-of-the-art two-frame and multi-frame methods. Experiments on a 62-clip dataset show the significant superiority of the proposed idea in both segmentation accuracy and model selection.</p><p>5 0.23917812 <a title="360-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correlation_Adaptive_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Trace_Lasso.html">93 iccv-2013-Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation by Trace Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jiashi Feng, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.</p><p>6 0.15179008 <a title="360-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Trajectory_Clustering_for_Motion_Segmentation.html">361 iccv-2013-Robust Trajectory Clustering for Motion Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ameet Talwalkar, Lester Mackey, Yadong Mu, Shih-Fu Chang, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Vision problems ranging from image clustering to motion segmentation to semi-supervised learning can naturally be framed as subspace segmentation problems, in which one aims to recover multiple low-dimensional subspaces from noisy and corrupted input data. Low-Rank Representation (LRR), a convex formulation of the subspace segmentation problem, is provably and empirically accurate on small problems but does not scale to the massive sizes of modern vision datasets. Moreover, past work aimed at scaling up low-rank matrix factorization is not applicable to LRR given its non-decomposable constraints. In this work, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for large-scale subspace segmentation that can cope with LRR ’s non-decomposable constraints and maintains LRR ’s strong recovery guarantees. This has immediate implications for the scalability of subspace segmentation, which we demonstrate on a benchmark face recognition dataset and in simulations. We then introduce novel applications of LRR-based subspace segmentation to large-scale semisupervised learning for multimedia event detection, concept detection, and image tagging. In each case, we obtain stateof-the-art results and order-of-magnitude speed ups.</p><p>5 0.6904332 <a title="360-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Correntropy_Induced_L2_Graph_for_Robust_Subspace_Clustering.html">94 iccv-2013-Correntropy Induced L2 Graph for Robust Subspace Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Kuan-Chuan Peng, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: Most sky models only describe the cloudiness ofthe overall sky by a single category or parameter such as sky index, which does not account for the distribution of the clouds across the sky. To capture variable cloudiness, we extend the concept of sky index to a random field indicating the level of cloudiness of each sky pixel in our proposed sky representation based on the Igawa sky model. We formulate the problem of solving the sky index of every sky pixel as a labeling problem, where an approximate solution can be efficiently found. Experimental results show that our proposed sky model has better expressiveness, stability with respect to variation in camera parameters, and geo-location estimation in outdoor images compared to the uniform sky index model. Potential applications of our proposed sky model include sky image rendering, where sky images can be generated with an arbitrary cloud distribution at any time and any location, previously impossible with traditional sky models.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.66476792 <a title="360-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Subspace_Clustering_via_Half-Quadratic_Minimization.html">360 iccv-2013-Robust Subspace Clustering via Half-Quadratic Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>3 0.62770283 <a title="360-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-What_is_the_Most_EfficientWay_to_Select_Nearest_Neighbor_Candidates_for_Fast_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search%3F.html">450 iccv-2013-What is the Most EfficientWay to Select Nearest Neighbor Candidates for Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search?</a></p>
<p>Author: Masakazu Iwamura, Tomokazu Sato, Koichi Kise</p><p>Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a basic and important technique used in many tasks such as object recognition. It involves two processes: selecting nearest neighbor candidates and performing a brute-force search of these candidates. Only the former though has scope for improvement. In most existing methods, it approximates the space by quantization. It then calculates all the distances between the query and all the quantized values (e.g., clusters or bit sequences), and selects a fixed number of candidates close to the query. The performance of the method is evaluated based on accuracy as a function of the number of candidates. This evaluation seems rational but poses a serious problem; it ignores the computational cost of the process of selection. In this paper, we propose a new ANNS method that takes into account costs in the selection process. Whereas existing methods employ computationally expensive techniques such as comparative sort and heap, the proposed method does not. This realizes a significantly more efficient search. We have succeeded in reducing computation times by one-third compared with the state-of-the- art on an experiment using 100 million SIFT features.</p><p>4 0.59955227 <a title="360-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Exemplar_Cut.html">150 iccv-2013-Exemplar Cut</a></p>
<p>Author: Jimei Yang, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid parametric and nonparametric algorithm, exemplar cut, for generating class-specific object segmentation hypotheses. For the parametric part, we train a pylon model on a hierarchical region tree as the energy function for segmentation. For the nonparametric part, we match the input image with each exemplar by using regions to obtain a score which augments the energy function from the pylon model. Our method thus generates a set of highly plausible segmentation hypotheses by solving a series of exemplar augmented graph cuts. Experimental results on the Graz and PASCAL datasets show that the proposed algorithm achievesfavorable segmentationperformance against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.5877192 <a title="360-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-GOSUS%3A_Grassmannian_Online_Subspace_Updates_with_Structured-Sparsity.html">182 iccv-2013-GOSUS: Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Xu, Vamsi K. Ithapu, Lopamudra Mukherjee, James M. Rehg, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online subspace learning in the context of sequential observations involving structured perturbations. In online subspace learning, the observations are an unknown mixture of two components presented to the model sequentially the main effect which pertains to the subspace and a residual/error term. If no additional requirement is imposed on the residual, it often corresponds to noise terms in the signal which were unaccounted for by the main effect. To remedy this, one may impose ‘structural’ contiguity, which has the intended effect of leveraging the secondary terms as a covariate that helps the estimation of the subspace itself, instead of merely serving as a noise residual. We show that the corresponding online estimation procedure can be written as an approximate optimization process on a Grassmannian. We propose an efficient numerical solution, GOSUS, Grassmannian Online Subspace Updates with Structured-sparsity, for this problem. GOSUS is expressive enough in modeling both homogeneous perturbations of the subspace and structural contiguities of outliers, and after certain manipulations, solvable — via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We evaluate the empirical performance of this algorithm on two problems of interest: online background subtraction and online multiple face tracking, and demonstrate that it achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art in near real time.</p><p>6 0.58687234 <a title="360-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Pictorial_Human_Spaces%3A_How_Well_Do_Humans_Perceive_a_3D_Articulated_Pose%3F.html">316 iccv-2013-Pictorial Human Spaces: How Well Do Humans Perceive a 3D Articulated Pose?</a></p>
