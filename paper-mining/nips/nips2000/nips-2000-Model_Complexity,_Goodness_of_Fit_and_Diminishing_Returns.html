<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>3 0.12008113 <a title="86-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Curves_for_Gaussian_Processes_Regression%3A_A_Framework_for_Good_Approximations.html">77 nips-2000-Learning Curves for Gaussian Processes Regression: A Framework for Good Approximations</a></p>
<p>Author: Dörthe Malzahn, Manfred Opper</p><p>Abstract: Based on a statistical mechanics approach, we develop a method for approximately computing average case learning curves for Gaussian process regression models. The approximation works well in the large sample size limit and for arbitrary dimensionality of the input space. We explain how the approximation can be systematically improved and argue that similar techniques can be applied to general likelihood models. 1</p><p>4 0.10412896 <a title="86-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-On_Reversing_Jensen%27s_Inequality.html">94 nips-2000-On Reversing Jensen's Inequality</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Alex Pentland</p><p>Abstract: Jensen's inequality is a powerful mathematical tool and one of the workhorses in statistical learning. Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen computes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then permits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statistical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction results are shown. 1</p><p>5 0.10223608 <a title="86-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>6 0.096649624 <a title="86-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Data_Clustering_by_Markovian_Relaxation_and_the_Information_Bottleneck_Method.html">38 nips-2000-Data Clustering by Markovian Relaxation and the Information Bottleneck Method</a></p>

<p>Author: Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Algebraic geometry is essential to learning theory. In hierarchical learning machines such as layered neural networks and gaussian mixtures, the asymptotic normality does not hold , since Fisher information matrices are singular. In this paper , the rigorous asymptotic form of the stochastic complexity is clarified based on resolution of singularities and two different problems are studied. (1) If the prior is positive, then the stochastic complexity is far smaller than BIO, resulting in the smaller generalization error than regular statistical models, even when the true distribution is not contained in the parametric model. (2) If Jeffreys' prior, which is coordinate free and equal to zero at singularities, is employed then the stochastic complexity has the same form as BIO. It is useful for model selection, but not for generalization. 1</p><p>4 0.5178715 <a title="86-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-Incorporating_Second-Order_Functional_Knowledge_for_Better_Option_Pricing.html">69 nips-2000-Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Dugas, Yoshua Bengio, François Bélisle, Claude Nadeau, René Garcia</p><p>Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in two of its arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of continuous functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modeling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.</p><p>5 0.50475079 <a title="86-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-High-temperature_Expansions_for_Learning_Models_of_Nonnegative_Data.html">64 nips-2000-High-temperature Expansions for Learning Models of Nonnegative Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Jakob Carlström</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents predictive gain scheduling, a technique for simplifying reinforcement learning problems by decomposition. Link admission control of self-similar call traffic is used to demonstrate the technique. The control problem is decomposed into on-line prediction of near-future call arrival rates, and precomputation of policies for Poisson call arrival processes. At decision time, the predictions are used to select among the policies. Simulations show that this technique results in significantly faster learning without any performance loss, compared to a reinforcement learning controller that does not decompose the problem. 1</p><p>2 0.90474313 <a title="86-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Bayes_Networks_on_Ice%3A_Robotic_Search_for_Antarctic_Meteorites.html">29 nips-2000-Bayes Networks on Ice: Robotic Search for Antarctic Meteorites</a></p>

<p>Author: Natalia Hernandez-Gardiol, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge for reinforcement learning is scaling up to large partially observable domains. In this paper, we show how a hierarchy of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher levels in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in time. We formalize this idea in a framework called Hierarchical Suffix Memory (HSM). HSM uses a memory-based SMDP learning method to rapidly propagate delayed reward across long decision sequences. We describe a detailed experimental study comparing memory vs. hierarchy using the HSM framework on a realistic corridor navigation task. 1</p><p>5 0.64492941 <a title="86-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Exact_Solutions_to_Time-Dependent_MDPs.html">48 nips-2000-Exact Solutions to Time-Dependent MDPs</a></p>
