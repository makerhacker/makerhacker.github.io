<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the

<p>Introduction: Last week I went to POSSCON in Columbia, South Carolina. It was an interesting
experience and a good reminder that not everyone in the world thinks like we
do in Silicon Valley.I gave two talks at the conference. One was a technical
talk about how to build realtime Big Data systems, and the other was a non-
technical talk about the things we do at BackType to be a super-productive
team. Both slide decks are embedded below.The Secrets of Building Realtime Big

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee ofBackType, a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the
company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome,
but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for
everyone.The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total
exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product
development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship.
Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through
the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for
myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity.No RulesThere are
a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of
the rulesarerules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about
the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you
work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.Because

<p>Introduction: Yesterday was my last day at Twitter. I left to start my own company. What
I'll be working on is very exciting (though I'm keeping it secret for
now).Leaving Twitter was a tough decision. I worked with a whole bunch of
great people on fascinating problems with some of the most interesting data in
the world. Ultimately though, I felt that if I didn't make this move, I
wouldregret itfor the rest of my life. So I put in my papers about a month ago
and then spent a month transitioning my team for my departure.This ends an
eventful three years that started with me joining BackType in January of 2010.
So much has happened in these past three years. I open-
sourcedCascalog,ElephantDB, andStorm, started writinga book, gavea lot of
talks, and in July of 2011 experienced the thrill ofbeing acquired. My
projects spread beyond BackType and Twitter to be relied on bydozens and
dozens of companies. Through all this, I learned an enormous amount about
entrepreneurship, product development, marketing,</p><p>3 0.23607914 <a title="35-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-08-Follow-up_to_%22The_mathematics_behind_Hadoop-based_systems%22.html">8 nathan marz storm-2010-03-08-Follow-up to "The mathematics behind Hadoop-based systems"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In aprevious post, I developed an equation modeling the stable runtime of an
iterative, batch-oriented workflow. We saw how the equation explained a number
of counter-intuitive behaviors of batch-oriented systems. In this post, we
will learn how to measure the amount of overhead versus dynamic time in a
workflow, which is the first step in applying the theory to optimize a
workflow.Recall that we started with the equation for the runtime of a single
iteration of a workflow:Runtime = Overhead + {Time to process one hour of
data} * {Hours of Data}T = O + P * HWe ended with the equation for the stable
runtime of a workflow that runs repeatedly:{Stable Runtime} = Overhead / (1 -
{Time to process one hour of data}T = O / (1 - P)Measuring O and PThe first
step towards utilizing this theory for optimizing your workflow will be to
measure the values of O and P for your workflow. This can be difficult if the
cluster is shared with lots of other jobs, as the P for each run will vary.

<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>5 0.21764839 <a title="35-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2009/nathan_marz_storm-2009-12-28-The_mathematics_behind_Hadoop-based_systems.html">1 nathan marz storm-2009-12-28-The mathematics behind Hadoop-based systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wish I had known this a year ago. Now, with some simple mathematics I can
finally answer:Why doesn't the speed of my workflow double when I double the
amount of processing power?Why does a 10% failure rate cause my runtime to go
up by 300%?How does optimizing out 30% of my workflow runtime cause the
runtime to decrease by 80%?How many machines should I have in my cluster to be
adequately performant and fault-tolerant?All of these questions are neatly
answered by one simple equation:Runtime = Overhead / (1 - {Time to process one
hour of data})We will derive this equation in a moment. First, let's briefly
discuss what I mean by "Hadoop-based system."1A common use-case of Hadoop is
running a workflow that processes a continuous stream of incoming data. The
workflow runs in a "while(true)" loop, and each iteration of the workflow
processes the data that accumulated since last iteration.The inspiration for
the following analysis can be summarized in a simple example. Let's say you
