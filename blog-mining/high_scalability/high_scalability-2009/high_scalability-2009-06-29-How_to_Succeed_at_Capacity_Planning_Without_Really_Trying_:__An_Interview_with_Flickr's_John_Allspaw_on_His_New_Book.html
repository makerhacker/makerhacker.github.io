[sent-34, score-0.562]
</p><p>2 Other capacity planning books assault you with models, math, and simulations. [sent-39, score-0.786]
</p><p>3 John has developed a common sense, low math approach to capacity planning that works using the system you already have. [sent-41, score-0.932]
</p><p>4 com, and I've written a book (The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources) about capacity planning for growing websites. [sent-49, score-0.976]
</p><p>5 This book is basically a guide to adaptive capacity planning for growing websites. [sent-51, score-0.976]
</p><p>6 Capacity planning is a term that to me means paying attention. [sent-57, score-0.471]
</p><p>7 I realize that's a lot more than a lot of organizations, but that rate of change requires that the capacity planning process is easily adjustable. [sent-104, score-0.839]
</p><p>8 I have a cloud, do I really need to capacity plan anymore? [sent-107, score-0.441]
</p><p>9 Can't I decrease my administrator-to-server ratio and reduce the cost of managing systems by removing capacity planning resources? [sent-109, score-0.786]
</p><p>10 But, using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run out of capacity in a particular resource. [sent-123, score-0.51]
</p><p>11 It seems to impact the entire application stack, but capacity planning is more of an operations thing and that may not have much impact in engineering. [sent-127, score-0.918]
</p><p>12 Capacity planning is a process, and should sit in the stack along with the other things that happen on a regular basis, like bug scrubs, like weekly meetings, etc. [sent-128, score-0.559]
</p><p>13 Planning, procurement, and measurement of capacity might lie on operations' shoulders, but intelligent use of it is everyone's business. [sent-131, score-0.428]
</p><p>14 You simply can't launch things like FlickrVideo and the Yahoo Photos migration without capacity being part of the requirements, so we've got a good feedback loop going with respect to operations and capacity. [sent-134, score-0.628]
</p><p>15 Studies say 4/5 of people like a trip to the dentist more than they like capacity planning. [sent-135, score-0.502]
</p><p>16 Because most of the cap planning literature out there are filled with boring math? [sent-138, score-0.414]
</p><p>17 Most dashboards say what happened, yours has an estimated days left before capacity runs out, which makes it actionable. [sent-152, score-0.44]
</p><p>18 How do you have enough capacity as a safety factor if traffic is so spikey? [sent-163, score-0.438]
</p><p>19 Capacity planning isn't the only part of successful web operations, and not everything is a capacity issue. [sent-166, score-0.786]
</p><p>20 Realize that being scalable means being able to easily add capacity wherever you need it, whenever you need it. [sent-197, score-0.51]

Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches:One source says Apple programmed the Infineon
chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So
if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area,
some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the
slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.Update:To get a

when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial. Cool

<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often
difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid
forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of
whatever performance data and tools are available.One unique Guerrilla tool is
Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational
Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing
application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally
recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance
Dynamics Company in 1994.Some reasons why you should understand this law:1. A
lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let
alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be
quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal
law of computational scaling provides that quantification.2. One the greatest
impediments to applying queueing</p><p>4 0.26407126 <a title="643-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>

users the response time was 6 seconds. And at 2000 users the site was

reputation started at 1000 users. Cheers to the company that had the guts to
give this a try.That which doesn't kill your site makes it stronger. Or at
least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not
really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In
addition, a lot of unexpected systemic things can happen when load increases

<p>Introduction: In Scalabilityissues for dummiesAlex Barrera talks movingly about the
challenges he faces trying to scale his startupinkzeeas the lone developer.
Inkzee is anonline news reader that automatically groups similar topics. This
is a cool problem and is one you know right away is going to have some killer
scalability problems as the number of feeds and the number of users increase.
And these problems lead to the point of the post, toexplain here what are
scalability problems and how deep the repercussions are for a small company,
which Alex does admirably.Some takeaways:Sites are composed of a frontend and
backend. The backend isn't visible to users, but it does all the work and this
is where the scalability problems show up.As more and more users use a site it
becomes slow because more users reveal bottlenecks in the system that weren't
visible before.There can be many many reasons for these bottlenecks. They are
often very hard to find because the backend systems are very complex and have</p><p>5 0.82092178 <a title="643-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Finding_an_excellent_LAMP_developer.html">193 high scalability-2007-12-26-Finding an excellent LAMP developer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>6 0.80823183 <a title="643-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-10-A_Perfect_Fifth_of_Notes_on_Scalability.html">1172 high scalability-2012-01-10-A Perfect Fifth of Notes on Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management.

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>4 0.9764418 <a title="643-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon%27s_EC2%3A_Pay_as_You_Grow_Could_Cut_Your_Costs_in_Half.html">195 high scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon's EC2: Pay as You Grow Could Cut Your Costs in Half</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: SummizeComputes Computing Resources for a Startup. Lots of nice
graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:
viaProductionScale, a nice Digital Web article onhow to setup S3 to store
media filesand how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758
GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale
article onNetwork performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3. 75MB/s
between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s

compute cloud) has added newinstance types(the class of machine you can rent)
with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look
out how their pricing stacks up.The quick conclusion:the more you scale the
more you save. A six node co</p><p>5 0.97575921 <a title="643-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_5%2C_2011.html">1093 high scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 5, 2011</a></p>

Uses About 900,000 Servers;eBay deploys 100TB of flash storageThe cloud isn't
for closers. Another gaming startup pulls back from the cloud by Derrick
Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into
higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in
the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy inZynga's
Z Cloud - Scale Fast Or Fail Fast By Merging Private And Public Clouds. An
architectural approach made all the more sensible with Amazon's new AWS Direct
Connect service, which enables lower latency and higher bandwidth services by
skipping the Internet and connecting directly to the AWS network.AWS Direct
