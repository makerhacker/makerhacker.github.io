the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a

single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: My company is developing a centralized web platform to service our clients. We
currently use about 3Mb/s on our uplink at our ISP serving web pages for about
100 clients. We'd like to offer them statistics that mean something to their
businesses and have been contemplating writing our own statistics code to
handle the task.All statistics would be gathered at the page view level and
we're implementing a HttpModule in ASP.Net 2.0 to handle the gather of the
data. That said, I'm curious to hear comments on writing this data (~500 bytes
of log data/page request). We need to write this data somewhere and then build
a process to aggregate the data into a warehouse application used in our
reporting system. Google Analytics is out of the question because we do not
want our hosting infrastructure dependant upon a remote server. Web Trends et
al. are too expensive for our clients.I'm thinking of a couple of options.1)

<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>5 0.72497451 <a title="135-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-12-Creating_Scalable_Digital_Libraries.html">856 high scalability-2010-07-12-Creating Scalable Digital Libraries</a></p>

<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>3 0.48116919 <a title="135-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Paper%3A_Understanding_and_Designing_New_Server_Architectures_for_Emerging_Warehouse-Computing_Environments.html">535 high scalability-2009-03-12-Paper: Understanding and Designing New Server Architectures for Emerging Warehouse-Computing Environments</a></p>

MudgeSteven ReinhardtThis International Symposium on Computer Architecture
paper seeks to understand and design next-generation servers for emerging
"warehouse-computing" environments. We make two key contributions. First, we
put together a detailed evaluation infrastructure including a new benchmark
suite for warehouse-computing workloads, and detailed performance, cost, and
power models, to quantitatively characterize bottlenecks. Second, we study a
new solution that incorporates volume non-server-class components in novel
packaging solutions, with memory sharing andflash-based disk caching. Our
results show that this approach has promise, with a 2X improvement on average
in performance-per-dollar for our benchmark suite.</p><p>4 0.457589 <a title="135-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-07-Paper%3A_A_Co-Relational_Model_of_Data_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks.html">1018 high scalability-2011-04-07-Paper: A Co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really
just two sides of the same coin? That's what Erik Meijerand Gavin Bierman
would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money"
article in the Communications of the ACM,A Co-Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks. You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true
:-) Some key points:In this article we present a mathematical data model for
the most common noSQL databases--namely, key/value relationships--and
demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational
data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships...we believe that our
categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the
same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores....In contrast to
common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the
question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme
sharding, the fac</p><p>5 0.42352611 <a title="135-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-24-A_Scalable%2C_Commodity_Data_Center_Network_Architecture.html">371 high scalability-2008-08-24-A Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>6 0.41109335 <a title="135-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-26-Google_Pro_Tip%3A_Use_Back-of-the-envelope-calculations_to_Choose_the_Best_Design.html">978 high scalability-2011-01-26-Google Pro Tip: Use Back-of-the-envelope-calculations to Choose the Best Design</a></p>
