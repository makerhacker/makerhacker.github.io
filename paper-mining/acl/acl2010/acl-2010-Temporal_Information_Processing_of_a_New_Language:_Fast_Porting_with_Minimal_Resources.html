<p>Author: WenTing Wang ; Jian Su ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic knowledge is important for discourse relation recognition. Yet only heuristically selected flat paths and 2-level production rules have been used to incorporate such information so far. In this paper we propose using tree kernel based approach to automatically mine the syntactic information from the parse trees for discourse analysis, applying kernel function to the tree structures directly. These structural syntactic features, together with other normal flat features are incorporated into our composite kernel to capture diverse knowledge for simultaneous discourse identification and classification for both explicit and implicit relations. The experiment shows tree kernel approach is able to give statistical significant improvements over flat syntactic path feature. We also illustrate that tree kernel approach covers more structure information than the production rules, which allows tree kernel to further incorporate information from a higher dimension space for possible better discrimination. Besides, we further propose to leverage on temporal ordering information to constrain the interpretation of discourse relation, which also demonstrate statistical significant improvements for discourse relation recognition on PDTB 2.0 for both explicit and implicit as well.

<p>Author: Cosmin Bejan ; Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines how a new class of nonparametric Bayesian models can be effectively applied to an open-domain event coreference task. Designed with the purpose of clustering complex linguistic objects, these models consider a potentially infinite number of features and categorical outcomes. The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross-document event coreference shows significant improvements of the models when compared against two baselines for this task.</p><p>6 0.098512031 <a title="225-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2010-A_Cognitive_Cost_Model_of_Annotations_Based_on_Eye-Tracking_Data.html">4 acl-2010-A Cognitive Cost Model of Annotations Based on Eye-Tracking Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Nancy Ide ; Collin Baker ; Christiane Fellbaum ; Rebecca Passonneau</p><p>Abstract: The Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC) project provides data and annotations to serve as the base for a communitywide annotation effort of a subset of the American National Corpus. The MASC infrastructure enables the incorporation of contributed annotations into a single, usable format that can then be analyzed as it is or ported to any of a variety of other formats. MASC includes data from a much wider variety of genres than existing multiply-annotated corpora of English, and the project is committed to a fully open model of distribution, without restriction, for all data and annotations produced or contributed. As such, MASC is the first large-scale, open, communitybased effort to create much needed language resources for NLP. This paper describes the MASC project, its corpus and annotations, and serves as a call for contributions of data and annotations from the language processing community.</p><p>3 0.60428315 <a title="225-lsi-3" href="./acl-2010-Learning_Script_Knowledge_with_Web_Experiments.html">165 acl-2010-Learning Script Knowledge with Web Experiments</a></p>

<p>Author: Erhard Hinrichs ; Marie Hinrichs ; Thomas Zastrow</p><p>Abstract: This software demonstration presents WebLicht (short for: Web-Based Linguistic Chaining Tool), a webbased service environment for the integration and use of language resources and tools (LRT). WebLicht is being developed as part of the D-SPIN project1. WebLicht is implemented as a web application so that there is no need for users to install any software on their own computers or to concern themselves with the technical details involved in building tool chains. The integrated web services are part of a prototypical infrastructure that was developed to facilitate chaining of LRT services. WebLicht allows the integration and use of distributed web services with standardized APIs. The nature of these open and standardized APIs makes it possible to access the web services from nearly any programming language, shell script or workflow engine (UIMA, Gate etc.) Additionally, an application for integration of additional services is available, allowing anyone to contribute his own web service. 1</p><p>5 0.53611624 <a title="225-lsi-5" href="./acl-2010-Annotation.html">31 acl-2010-Annotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Power</p><p>Abstract: We describe the strategy currently pursued for verbalising OWL ontologies by sentences in Controlled Natural Language (i.e., combining generic rules for realising logical patterns with ontology-specific lexicons for realising atomic terms for individuals, classes, and properties) and argue that its success depends on assumptions about the complexity of terms and axioms in the ontology. We then show, through analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that although these assumptions could in principle be violated, they are overwhelmingly respected in practice by ontology developers.</p><p>2 0.72034043 <a title="225-lda-2" href="./acl-2010-Fine-Grained_Genre_Classification_Using_Structural_Learning_Algorithms.html">117 acl-2010-Fine-Grained Genre Classification Using Structural Learning Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhili Wu ; Katja Markert ; Serge Sharoff</p><p>Abstract: Prior use of machine learning in genre classification used a list of labels as classification categories. However, genre classes are often organised into hierarchies, e.g., covering the subgenres of fiction. In this paper we present a method of using the hierarchy of labels to improve the classification accuracy. As a testbed for this approach we use the Brown Corpus as well as a range of other corpora, including the BNC, HGC and Syracuse. The results are not encouraging: apart from the Brown corpus, the improvements of our structural classifier over the flat one are not statistically significant. We discuss the relation between structural learning performance and the visual and distributional balance of the label hierarchy, suggesting that only balanced hierarchies might profit from structural learning.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.71828431 <a title="225-lda-3" href="./acl-2010-Temporal_Information_Processing_of_a_New_Language%3A_Fast_Porting_with_Minimal_Resources.html">225 acl-2010-Temporal Information Processing of a New Language: Fast Porting with Minimal Resources</a></p>

We propose two new measures based upon the well-known measures of mutual information and pointwise mutual information. Expected probabilities are derived from automatically trained Aggregate Markov Models. On three collocation gold standards, we find the new association measures vary in their effectiveness.</p><p>5 0.55514592 <a title="225-lda-5" href="./acl-2010-Improving_the_Use_of_Pseudo-Words_for_Evaluating_Selectional_Preferences.html">148 acl-2010-Improving the Use of Pseudo-Words for Evaluating Selectional Preferences</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathanael Chambers ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: This paper improves the use of pseudowords as an evaluation framework for selectional preferences. While pseudowords originally evaluated word sense disambiguation, they are now commonly used to evaluate selectional preferences. A selectional preference model ranks a set of possible arguments for a verb by their semantic fit to the verb. Pseudo-words serve as a proxy evaluation for these decisions. The evaluation takes an argument of a verb like drive (e.g. car), pairs it with an alternative word (e.g. car/rock), and asks a model to identify the original. This paper studies two main aspects of pseudoword creation that affect performance results. (1) Pseudo-word evaluations often evaluate only a subset of the words. We show that selectional preferences should instead be evaluated on the data in its entirety. (2) Different approaches to selecting partner words can produce overly optimistic evaluations. We offer suggestions to address these factors and present a simple baseline that outperforms the state-ofthe-art by 13% absolute on a newspaper domain.</p><p>6 0.55189902 <a title="225-lda-6" href="./acl-2010-Extraction_and_Approximation_of_Numerical_Attributes_from_the_Web.html">113 acl-2010-Extraction and Approximation of Numerical Attributes from the Web</a></p>
