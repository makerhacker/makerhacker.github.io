</p><p>8 1  Introduction  Local "belief propagation" (BP) algorithms such as those introduced by Pearl are guaranteed to converge to the correct marginal posterior probabilities in tree-like graphical models. [sent-16, score-0.176]
</p><p>9 On the one hand, a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance for BP algorithms applied to networks with loops. [sent-18, score-0.081]
</p><p>10 One dramatic case is the near Shannon-limit performance of "Turbo codes" , whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to BP on a loopy network [2, 6]. [sent-19, score-0.067]
</p><p>11 For some problems in computer vision involving networks with loops, BP has also shown to be accurate and to converge very quickly [2, 1, 7]. [sent-20, score-0.113]
</p><p>12 We show that BP is the first in a progression of local message-passing algorithms, each giving equivalent results to a corresponding approximation from statistical physics known as the "Kikuchi" approximation to the Gibbs free energy. [sent-24, score-0.276]
</p><p>13 These algorithms have the attractive property of being user-adjustable: by paying some additional computational cost, one can obtain considerable improvement in the accuracy of one's approximation, and can sometimes obtain a convergent message-passing algorithm when ordinary BP does not converge. [sent-25, score-0.189]
</p><p>14 2  Belief propagation fixed-points are zero gradient points of the Bethe free energy  We assume that we are given an undirected graphical model of N nodes with pairwise potentials (a Markov network). [sent-26, score-0.555]
</p><p>15 The state of each node i is denoted by Xi, and the joint probability distribution function is given by P(Xl,X2, . [sent-28, score-0.077]
</p><p>16 ,XN)  = z II 'l/Jij(Xi,Xj) II 'l/Ji(Xi) 1  ij  (1)  i  where 'l/Ji(Xi) is the local "evidence" for node i, 'l/Jij(Xi, Xj) is the compatibility matrix between nodes i and j, and Z is a normalization constant. [sent-31, score-0.32]
</p><p>17 Note that we are subsuming any fixed evidence nodes into our definition of 'l/Ji(Xi). [sent-32, score-0.129]
</p><p>18 The standard BP update rules are: mij(Xj)  a  f-  L 'l/Jij (Xi, Xj)'l/Ji(Xi) II mki(xi) kEN(i)\j  (2)  Xi  bi(Xi)  a'I/Ji (Xi)  f-  II  mki(xi)  (3)  kEN(i) where a denotes a normalization constant and N(i)\j means all nodes neighboring node i, except j. [sent-33, score-0.34]
</p><p>19 Here mij refers to the message that node i sends to node j and bi is the belief (approximate marginal posterior probability) at node i, obtained by multiplying all incoming messages to that node by the local evidence. [sent-34, score-0.937]
</p><p>20 Similarly, we can define the belief bij(Xi,Xj) at the pair of nodes (Xi, Xj) as the product of the local potentials and all messages incoming to the pair of nodes: bij(Xi, Xj) = acPij(Xi, Xj) ITkEN(i)\j mki(Xi) IT1EN(j)\i mlj (Xj), where cPij(Xi,Xj) 'l/Jij(Xi,Xj)'l/Ji(Xi)'l/Jj(Xj) . [sent-35, score-0.55]
</p><p>21 =  Claim 1: Let {mij} be a set of BP messages and let {bij , bi} be the beliefs calculated from those messages. [sent-36, score-0.389]
</p><p>22 Then the beliefs are fixed-points of the BP algorithm if and only if they are zero gradient points of the Bethe free energy, Ff3:  LL ij  bij(Xi,Xj) [In bij(Xi, Xj) -lncPij(xi,Xj)]  Xi,Xj  Xi  subject to the normalization and marginalization constraints: LXi bi(Xi) = 1, L Xi bij(Xi,Xj) = bj(xj). [sent-37, score-0.365]
</p><p>23 )  To prove this claim we add Lagrange multipliers to form a Lagrangian L: Aij (x j ) is the multiplier corresponding to the constraint that bij (Xi, Xj) marginalizes down to bj(xj), and "(ij, "(i are multipliers corresponding to the normalization constraints. [sent-39, score-0.239]
</p><p>24 jJi (Xi) + LjEN(i) Aji (Xi) + "(i路 Setting Aij (Xj) = In OkEN(j)\i mkj (Xj) and using the marginalization constraints, we find that the stationary conditions on the Lagrangian are equivalent to the BP fixed-point conditions. [sent-44, score-0.082]
</p><p>25 (Empirically, we find that stable BP fixed-points correspond to local minima of the Bethe free energy, rather than maxima or saddle-points. [sent-45, score-0.128]
</p><p>26 The free energy formulation clarifies the relationship to variational approaches which also minimize an approximate free energy [3]. [sent-49, score-0.522]
</p><p>27 For example, the mean field approximation finds a set of {b i } that minimize:  FMF({bd) = -  LL ij  bi(Xi)bj(xj) In? [sent-50, score-0.099]
</p><p>28 The BP free energy includes first-order terms bi(Xi) as well as second-order terms bij (Xi, Xj), while the mean field free energy uses only the first order ones. [sent-53, score-0.573]
</p><p>29 It is easy to show that the BP free energy is exact for trees while the mean field one is not. [sent-54, score-0.248]
</p><p>30 Kabashima and Saad [4] have previously pointed out the correspondence between BP and the Bethe approximation (expressed using the TAP formalism) for some specific graphical models with random disorder. [sent-56, score-0.095]
</p><p>31 " [4]  3  Kikuchi Approximations to the Gibbs Free Energy  The Bethe approximation, for which the energy and entropy are approximated by terms that involve at most pairs of nodes, is the simplest version of the Kikuchi "cluster variational method. [sent-58, score-0.146]
</p><p>32 " [5, 10] In a general Kikuchi approximation, the free energy is approximated as a sum of the free energies of basic clusters of nodes, minus the free energy of over-counted cluster intersections, minus the free energy of the over-counted intersections of intersections, and so on. [sent-59, score-1.229]
</p><p>33 Let R be a set of regions that include some chosen basic clusters of nodes, their intersections, the intersections of the intersections, and so on. [sent-60, score-0.313]
</p><p>34 The choice of basic clusters determines the Kikuchi approximation- for the Bethe approximation, the basic clusters consist of all linked pairs of nodes. [sent-61, score-0.286]
</p><p>35 Let Xr be the state of the nodes in region r and br(xr) be the "belief" in X r . [sent-62, score-0.209]
</p><p>36 We define the energy of a region by  Er(xr) == -In TIij 'l/Jij (Xi, Xj) - In TIi 'l/Ji(Xi) == -In 'l/Jr(xr ), where the products are over all interactions contained within the region r. [sent-63, score-0.309]
</p><p>37 For models with higher than pair-wise interactions, the region energy is generalized to include those interactions as well. [sent-64, score-0.26]
</p><p>38 The Kikuchi free energy is  FK  =  2:: (2:: Cr  br(xr)Er(xr) +  x. [sent-65, score-0.248]
</p><p>39 rER  2::  (6)  br(xr) IOgbr(Xr))  XT'  where Cr is the over-counting number of region r, defined by: Cr = 1- LSEStLper(r) C s where super(r) is the set of all super-regions of r. [sent-67, score-0.08]
</p><p>40 The belief br (Q: r ) in region r has several constraints: it must sum to one and be consistent with the beliefs in regions which intersect with r. [sent-69, score-0.48]
</p><p>41 In general, increasing the size of the basic clusters improves the approximation one obtains by minimizing the Kikuchi free energy. [sent-70, score-0.319]
</p><p>42 4  Generalized belief propagation (G BP)  Minimizing the Kikuchi free energy subject to the constraints on the beliefs is not simple. [sent-71, score-0.636]
</p><p>43 Nearly all applications of the Kikuchi approximation in the physics literature exploit symmetries in the underlying physical system and the choice of clusters to reduce the number of equations that need to be solved from O(N) to 0(1). [sent-72, score-0.189]
</p><p>44 But just as the Bethe free energy can be minimized by the BP algorithm, we introduce a class of analogous genemlized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms that minimize an arbitrary Kikuchi free energy. [sent-73, score-0.66]
</p><p>45 We present a "canonical" GBP algorithm which has the nice property of reducing to ordinary BP at the Bethe level. [sent-76, score-0.161]
</p><p>46 We introduce messages mrs(xs) between all regions r and their "direct sub-regions" s. [sent-77, score-0.321]
</p><p>47 ") It is helpful to think of this as a message from those nodes in r but not in s (which we denote by r\s) to the nodes in s. [sent-79, score-0.35]
</p><p>48 Intuitively, we want messages to propagate information that lies outside of a region into it. [sent-80, score-0.356]
</p><p>49 Thus, for a given region r, we want the belief br(xr) to depend on exactly those messages mr,s, that start outside ofthe region r and go into the region r. [sent-81, score-0.636]
</p><p>50 We define this set of messages M(r) to be those messages mr,s, (xs,) such that region r'\s' has no nodes in common with region r, and such that region s' is a sub-region of r or the same as region r. [sent-82, score-1.001]
</p><p>51 We also define the set M(r, s) of messages to be all those messages that start in a sub-region of r and also belong to M(s), and we define M(r)\M(s) to be those messages that are in M(r) but not in M(s). [sent-83, score-0.828]
</p><p>52 The canonical generalized belief propagation update rules are:  mrs  +- Q:  [2::  br  II  'l/Jr\s(xr\s) m,1I ,"  X'\'  +- Q:'l/Jr(x r )  II  EM(r)\M(s)  mr,s,  II  mrllsll] / m,' "  mr,s,  (7)  EM(r,s) (8)  m" . [sent-84, score-0.679]
</p><p>53 ,EM(r)  where for brevity we have suppressed the functional dependences of the beliefs and messages. [sent-85, score-0.113]
</p><p>54 The messages are updated starting with the messages into the smallest  regions first. [sent-86, score-0.597]
</p><p>55 One can then use the newly computed messages in the product over M(r, s) of the message-update rule. [sent-87, score-0.276]
</p><p>56 Claim 2: Let {mrs(xs)} be a set of canonical GBP messages and let {br(xr)} be the beliefs calculated from those messages. [sent-89, score-0.54]
</p><p>57 Then the beliefs are fixed-points of the canonical GBP algorithm if and only if they are zero gradient points of the constrained Kikuchi free energy FK. [sent-90, score-0.512]
</p><p>58 We prove this claim by adding Lagrange multipliers: 'Yr to enforce the normalization of br and Ars(Xs) to enforce the consistency of each region r with all of its direct sub-regions s. [sent-91, score-0.374]
</p><p>59 This set of consistency constraints is actually more than sufficient, but there is no harm in adding extra constraints. [sent-92, score-0.083]
</p><p>60 We then rotate to another set of Lagrange multipliers /l-rs(xs) of equal dimensionality which enforce a linear combination of the original constraints: /l-rs (xs) enforces all those constraints involving marginalizations by all direct super-regions r' of s into s except that of region r itself. [sent-93, score-0.274]
</p><p>61 , b(x~) where R(/l-rs) is the set of all regions which receive the message /l-rs in the belief update rule of the canonical algorithm. [sent-96, score-0.468]
</p><p>62 ) Finally, we differentiate the Kikuchi free energy with respect to br(r), and identify /l-rs(xs) = lnmrs(xs) to obtain the canonical GBP belief update rules, Eq. [sent-102, score-0.579]
</p><p>63 Using the belief update rules in the marginalization constraints, we obtain the canonical GBP message update rules, Eq. [sent-104, score-0.566]
</p><p>64 It is clear from this proof outline that other GBP message passing algorithms which are equivalent to the Kikuchi approximation exist. [sent-106, score-0.208]
</p><p>65 If one writes any set of constraints which are sufficient to insure the consistency of all Kikuchi regions, one can associate the exponentiated Lagrange multipliers of those constraints with a set of messages. [sent-107, score-0.18]
</p><p>66 The GBP algorithms we have described solve exactly those networks which have the topology of a tree of basic clusters. [sent-108, score-0.083]
</p><p>67 This is reminiscent of Pearl's method of clustering [8], wherein wherein one groups clusters of nodes into "super-nodes," and then applies a belief propagation method to the equivalent super-node lattice. [sent-109, score-0.564]
</p><p>68 We can show that the clustering method, using Kikuchi clusters as super-nodes, also gives results equivalent to the Kikuchi approximation for those lattices and cluster choices where there are no intersections between the intersections of the Kikuchi basic clusters. [sent-110, score-0.588]
</p><p>69 5  Application to Specific Lattices  We illustrate the canonical G BP algorithm for the Kikuchi approximation of overlapping 4-node clusters on a square lattice of nodes. [sent-112, score-0.451]

<p>Author: Jonathan S. Yedidia, William T. Freeman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest.

<p>Author: Rich Caruana, Steve Lawrence, C. Lee Giles</p><p>Abstract: The conventional wisdom is that backprop nets with excess hidden units generalize poorly. We show that nets with excess capacity generalize well when trained with backprop and early stopping. Experiments suggest two reasons for this: 1) Overfitting can vary significantly in different regions of the model. Excess capacity allows better fit to regions of high non-linearity, and backprop often avoids overfitting the regions of low non-linearity. 2) Regardless of size, nets learn task subcomponents in similar sequence. Big nets pass through stages similar to those learned by smaller nets. Early stopping can stop training the large net when it generalizes comparably to a smaller net. We also show that conjugate gradient can yield worse generalization because it overfits regions of low non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity.</p><p>4 0.10999725 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>5 0.10706961 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Error-correcting_Codes_on_a_Bethe-like_Lattice.html">47 nips-2000-Error-correcting Codes on a Bethe-like Lattice</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan S. Yedidia, William T. Freeman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi approximations.

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.</p><p>4 0.30715871 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Processing_of_Time_Series_by_Neural_Circuits_with_Biologically_Realistic_Synaptic_Dynamics.html">104 nips-2000-Processing of Time Series by Neural Circuits with Biologically Realistic Synaptic Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>6 0.3036961 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-What_Can_a_Single_Neuron_Compute%3F.html">146 nips-2000-What Can a Single Neuron Compute?</a></p>
