<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Bo Han ; Kuan Li ; Stephan Hyeonjun Stiller ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop an approach to tackle the problem of verb selection for learners of English as a second language (ESL) by using features from the output of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL). Unlike existing approaches to verb selection that use local features such as n-grams, our approach exploits semantic features which explicitly model the usage context of the verb. The verb choice highly depends on its usage context which is not consistently captured by local features. We then combine these semantic features with other local features under the generalized perceptron learning framework. Experiments on both indomain and out-of-domain corpora show that our approach outperforms the baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>3 0.29528633 <a title="68-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-What_a_Parser_Can_Learn_from_a_Semantic_Role_Labeler_and_Vice_Versa.html">121 emnlp-2010-What a Parser Can Learn from a Semantic Role Labeler and Vice Versa</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Boxwell ; Dennis Mehay ; Chris Brew</p><p>Abstract: In many NLP systems, there is a unidirectional flow of information in which a parser supplies input to a semantic role labeler. In this paper, we build a system that allows information to flow in both directions. We make use of semantic role predictions in choosing a single-best parse. This process relies on an averaged perceptron model to distinguish likely semantic roles from erroneous ones. Our system penalizes parses that give rise to low-scoring semantic roles. To explore the consequences of this we perform two experiments. First, we use a baseline generative model to produce n-best parses, which are then re-ordered by our semantic model. Second, we use a modified version of our semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time. The performance of this modified labeler is weaker than that of our best full SRL, because it is restricted to features that can be computed directly from the parser’s packed chart. For both experiments, the resulting semantic predictions are then used to select parses. Finally, we feed the selected parses produced by each experiment to the full version of our semantic role labeler. We find that SRL performance can be improved over this baseline by selecting parses with likely semantic roles.</p><p>4 0.14461285 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Discriminative_Word_Alignment_with_a_Function_Word_Reordering_Model.html">36 emnlp-2010-Discriminative Word Alignment with a Function Word Reordering Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Chris Dyer ; Philip Resnik</p><p>Abstract: We address the modeling, parameter estimation and search challenges that arise from the introduction of reordering models that capture non-local reordering in alignment modeling. In particular, we introduce several reordering models that utilize (pairs of) function words as contexts for alignment reordering. To address the parameter estimation challenge, we propose to estimate these reordering models from a relatively small amount of manuallyaligned corpora. To address the search challenge, we devise an iterative local search algorithm that stochastically explores reordering possibilities. By capturing non-local reordering phenomena, our proposed alignment model bears a closer resemblance to stateof-the-art translation model. Empirical results show significant improvements in alignment quality as well as in translation performance over baselines in a large-scale ChineseEnglish translation task.</p><p>5 0.12709326 <a title="68-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Combining_Unsupervised_and_Supervised_Alignments_for_MT%3A_An_Empirical_Study.html">29 emnlp-2010-Combining Unsupervised and Supervised Alignments for MT: An Empirical Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinxi Xu ; Antti-Veikko Rosti</p><p>Abstract: Word alignment plays a central role in statistical MT (SMT) since almost all SMT systems extract translation rules from word aligned parallel training data. While most SMT systems use unsupervised algorithms (e.g. GIZA++) for training word alignment, supervised methods, which exploit a small amount of human-aligned data, have become increasingly popular recently. This work empirically studies the performance of these two classes of alignment algorithms and explores strategies to combine them to improve overall system performance. We used two unsupervised aligners, GIZA++ and HMM, and one supervised aligner, ITG, in this study. To avoid language and genre specific conclusions, we ran experiments on test sets consisting of two language pairs (Chinese-to-English and Arabicto-English) and two genres (newswire and weblog). Results show that the two classes of algorithms achieve the same level of MT perfor- mance. Modest improvements were achieved by taking the union of the translation grammars extracted from different alignments. Significant improvements (around 1.0 in BLEU) were achieved by combining outputs of different systems trained with different alignments. The improvements are consistent across languages and genres.</p><p>6 0.1121353 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation_Grammars_Extracted_from_Alignment_Posterior_Probabilities.html">57 emnlp-2010-Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation Grammars Extracted from Alignment Posterior Probabilities</a></p>

<p>Author: Kostadin Cholakov ; Gertjan van Noord</p><p>Abstract: Unknown words are a hindrance to the performance of hand-crafted computational grammars of natural language. However, words with incomplete and incorrect lexical entries pose an even bigger problem because they can be the cause of a parsing failure despite being listed in the lexicon of the grammar. Such lexical entries are hard to detect and even harder to correct. We employ an error miner to pinpoint words with problematic lexical entries. An automated lexical acquisition technique is then used to learn new entries for those words which allows the grammar to parse previously uncovered sentences successfully. We test our method on a large-scale grammar of Dutch and a set of sentences for which this grammar fails to produce a parse. The application of the method enables the grammar to cover 83.76% of those sentences with an accuracy of 86.15%.</p><p>3 0.54974967 <a title="68-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Hybrid_Morpheme-Word_Representation_for_Machine_Translation_of_Morphologically_Rich_Languages.html">5 emnlp-2010-A Hybrid Morpheme-Word Representation for Machine Translation of Morphologically Rich Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Minh-Thang Luong ; Preslav Nakov ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: We propose a language-independent approach for improving statistical machine translation for morphologically rich languages using a hybrid morpheme-word representation where the basic unit of translation is the morpheme, but word boundaries are respected at all stages of the translation process. Our model extends the classic phrase-based model by means of (1) word boundary-aware morpheme-level phrase extraction, (2) minimum error-rate training for a morpheme-level translation model using word-level BLEU, and (3) joint scoring with morpheme- and word-level language models. Further improvements are achieved by combining our model with the classic one. The evaluation on English to Finnish using Europarl (714K sentence pairs; 15.5M English words) shows statistically significant improvements over the classic model based on BLEU and human judgments.</p><p>4 0.35838547 <a title="68-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-What_a_Parser_Can_Learn_from_a_Semantic_Role_Labeler_and_Vice_Versa.html">121 emnlp-2010-What a Parser Can Learn from a Semantic Role Labeler and Vice Versa</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Boxwell ; Dennis Mehay ; Chris Brew</p><p>Abstract: In many NLP systems, there is a unidirectional flow of information in which a parser supplies input to a semantic role labeler. In this paper, we build a system that allows information to flow in both directions. We make use of semantic role predictions in choosing a single-best parse. This process relies on an averaged perceptron model to distinguish likely semantic roles from erroneous ones. Our system penalizes parses that give rise to low-scoring semantic roles. To explore the consequences of this we perform two experiments. First, we use a baseline generative model to produce n-best parses, which are then re-ordered by our semantic model. Second, we use a modified version of our semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time. The performance of this modified labeler is weaker than that of our best full SRL, because it is restricted to features that can be computed directly from the parser’s packed chart. For both experiments, the resulting semantic predictions are then used to select parses. Finally, we feed the selected parses produced by each experiment to the full version of our semantic role labeler. We find that SRL performance can be improved over this baseline by selecting parses with likely semantic roles.</p><p>5 0.33261287 <a title="68-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Learning_First-Order_Horn_Clauses_from_Web_Text.html">72 emnlp-2010-Learning First-Order Horn Clauses from Web Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Schoenmackers ; Jesse Davis ; Oren Etzioni ; Daniel Weld</p><p>Abstract: input. Even the entire Web corpus does not explicitly answer all questions, yet inference can uncover many implicit answers. But where do inference rules come from? This paper investigates the problem of learning inference rules from Web text in an unsupervised, domain-independent manner. The SHERLOCK system, described herein, is a first-order learner that acquires over 30,000 Horn clauses from Web text. SHERLOCK embodies several innovations, including a novel rule scoring function based on Statistical Relevance (Salmon et al., 1971) which is effective on ambiguous, noisy and incomplete Web extractions. Our experiments show that inference over the learned rules discovers three times as many facts (at precision 0.8) as the TEXTRUNNER system which merely extracts facts explicitly stated in Web text.</p><p>6 0.33098131 <a title="68-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Fusing_Eye_Gaze_with_Speech_Recognition_Hypotheses_to_Resolve_Exophoric_References_in_Situated_Dialogue.html">53 emnlp-2010-Fusing Eye Gaze with Speech Recognition Hypotheses to Resolve Exophoric References in Situated Dialogue</a></p>
