<p>Author: Ndapandula Nakashole ; Gerhard Weikum ; Fabian Suchanek</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents PATTY: a large resource for textual patterns that denote binary relations between entities. The patterns are semantically typed and organized into a subsumption taxonomy. The PATTY system is based on efficient algorithms for frequent itemset mining and can process Web-scale corpora. It harnesses the rich type system and entity population of large knowledge bases. The PATTY taxonomy comprises 350,569 pattern synsets. Random-sampling-based evaluation shows a pattern accuracy of 84.7%. PATTY has 8,162 subsumptions, with a random-sampling-based precision of 75%.

<p>Author: Liwei Chen ; Yansong Feng ; Lei Zou ; Dongyan Zhao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate different usages of feature representations in the web person name disambiguation task which has been suffering from the mismatch of vocabulary and lack of clues in web environments. In literature, the latter receives less attention and remains more challenging. We explore the feature space in this task and argue that collecting person specific evidences from a corpus level can provide a more reasonable and robust estimation for evaluating a feature’s importance in a given web page. This can alleviate the lack of clues where discriminative features can be reasonably weighted by taking their corpus level importance into account, not just relying on the current local context. We therefore propose a topic-based model to exploit the person specific global importance and embed it into the person name similarity. The experimental results show that the corpus level topic in- formation provides more stable evidences for discriminative features and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on three WePS datasets.</p><p>4 0.10067191 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Reading_The_Web_with_Learned_Syntactic-Semantic_Inference_Rules.html">110 emnlp-2012-Reading The Web with Learned Syntactic-Semantic Inference Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Amarnag Subramanya ; Fernando Pereira ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We study how to extend a large knowledge base (Freebase) by reading relational information from a large Web text corpus. Previous studies on extracting relational knowledge from text show the potential of syntactic patterns for extraction, but they do not exploit background knowledge of other relations in the knowledge base. We describe a distributed, Web-scale implementation of a path-constrained random walk model that learns syntactic-semantic inference rules for binary relations from a graph representation of the parsed text and the knowledge base.

<p>Author: Vivi Nastase ; Alex Judea ; Katja Markert ; Michael Strube</p><p>Abstract: Computational approaches to metonymy resolution have focused almost exclusively on the local context, especially the constraints placed on a potentially metonymic word by its grammatical collocates. We expand such approaches by taking into account the larger context. Our algorithm is tested on the data from the metonymy resolution task (Task 8) at SemEval 2007. The results show that incorporation of the global context can improve over the use of the local context alone, depending on the types of metonymies addressed. As a second contribution, we move towards unsupervised resolution of metonymies, made feasible by considering ontological relations as possible readings. We show that such an unsupervised approach delivers promising results: it beats the supervised most frequent sense baseline and performs close to a supervised approach using only standard lexico-syntactic features.</p><p>6 0.055430342 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Natural_Language_Questions_for_the_Web_of_Data.html">97 emnlp-2012-Natural Language Questions for the Web of Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Lin ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Entity linking systems link noun-phrase mentions in text to their corresponding Wikipedia articles. However, NLP applications would gain from the ability to detect and type all entities mentioned in text, including the long tail of entities not prominent enough to have their own Wikipedia articles. In this paper we show that once the Wikipedia entities mentioned in a corpus of textual assertions are linked, this can further enable the detection and fine-grained typing of the unlinkable entities. Our proposed method for detecting unlinkable entities achieves 24% greater accuracy than a Named Entity Recognition baseline, and our method for fine-grained typing is able to propagate over 1,000 types from linked Wikipedia entities to unlinkable entities. Detection and typing of unlinkable entities can increase yield for NLP applications such as typed question answering.</p><p>3 0.29851082 <a title="30-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Answering_Opinion_Questions_on_Products_by_Exploiting_Hierarchical_Organization_of_Consumer_Reviews.html">20 emnlp-2012-Answering Opinion Questions on Products by Exploiting Hierarchical Organization of Consumer Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxing Yu ; Zheng-Jun Zha ; Tat-Seng Chua</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions about products by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. The hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes following their parent-child relations. For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored. We develop a new framework for opinion Questions Answering, which enables accurate question analysis and effective answer generation by making use the hierarchy. In particular, we first identify the (explicit/implicit) product aspects asked in the questions and their sub-aspects by referring to the hierarchy. We then retrieve the corresponding review fragments relevant to the aspects from the hierarchy. In order to gener- ate appropriate answers from the review fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach for answer generation by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, diversity, and parent-child relations among the aspects. We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains. The evaluated corpus contains 70,359 consumer reviews and 220 questions on these products. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>4 0.29755533 <a title="30-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Detecting_Subgroups_in_Online_Discussions_by_Modeling_Positive_and_Negative_Relations_among_Participants.html">32 emnlp-2012-Detecting Subgroups in Online Discussions by Modeling Positive and Negative Relations among Participants</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed Hassan ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: A mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) relations exist among users in most social media applications. However, many such applications do not allow users to explicitly express the polarity of their interactions. As a result most research has either ignored negative links or was limited to the few domains where such relations are explicitly expressed (e.g. Epinions trust/distrust). We study text exchanged between users in online communities. We find that the polarity of the links between users can be predicted with high accuracy given the text they exchange. This allows us to build a signed network representation of discussions; where every edge has a sign: positive to denote a friendly relation, or negative to denote an antagonistic relation. We also connect our analysis to social psychology theories of balance. We show that the automatically predicted networks are consistent with those theories. Inspired by that, we present a technique for identifying subgroups in discussions by partitioning singed networks representing them.</p><p>5 0.29670355 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Reading_The_Web_with_Learned_Syntactic-Semantic_Inference_Rules.html">110 emnlp-2012-Reading The Web with Learned Syntactic-Semantic Inference Rules</a></p>
<p>Author: Ni Lao ; Amarnag Subramanya ; Fernando Pereira ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: We study how to extend a large knowledge base (Freebase) by reading relational information from a large Web text corpus. Previous studies on extracting relational knowledge from text show the potential of syntactic patterns for extraction, but they do not exploit background knowledge of other relations in the knowledge base. We describe a distributed, Web-scale implementation of a path-constrained random walk model that learns syntactic-semantic inference rules for binary relations from a graph representation of the parsed text and the knowledge base. Experiments show significant accuracy improvements in binary relation prediction over methods that consider only text, or only the existing knowledge base.</p><p>6 0.29444942 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Joint_Inference_for_Event_Timeline_Construction.html">72 emnlp-2012-Joint Inference for Event Timeline Construction</a></p>
