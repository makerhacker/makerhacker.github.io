</p><p>7 I give them feedback on what they did well and what they did poorly. [sent-9, score-0.165]
</p><p>8 I've found that candidates really appreciate my candor about their rejection. [sent-15, score-0.5]
</p><p>9 They appreciate being told why they failed, especially because everyone else is so impersonal and non-specific about rejections. [sent-16, score-0.399]
</p><p>10 For example, I might tell the candidate how I thought the project he described was interesting. [sent-18, score-0.943]
</p><p>11 I haven't yet been at a loss for something nice to say to a candidate, and it would be a rare candidate for that to happen. [sent-20, score-0.618]

</p><p>13 I tell the candidate what we're looking for and why I think they're not qualified. [sent-22, score-0.767]
</p><p>14 Let's face it: candidates know when they didn't do a good job. [sent-23, score-0.471]
</p><p>15 I tell the candidate that I know it's possible that we're making a mistake, that coding questions aren't always the most accurate indicators, but that it's the decision we have to make based on the results of the interview. [sent-25, score-1.054]
</p><p>16 Finally, I give candidates a chance to give me feedback. [sent-26, score-0.527]
</p><p>17 I ask what they thought about our interview process, and I ask what I could do better as an interviewer. [sent-27, score-0.447]
</p><p>18 Plus, giving candidates the opportunity to criticize me makes the process feel a lot less one-sided. [sent-29, score-0.645]
</p><p>19 I'm really happy about my decision to reject candidates on the spot at the end of phone interviews rather than with impersonal emails. [sent-30, score-1.217]
</p><p>20 I don't feel like an asshole anymore, and candidates seem to appreciate the feedback. [sent-31, score-0.713]

<p>Introduction: Back when I was a sophomore at Stanford, I cold emailedJohn McCarthy(inventor
of Lisp, one of the godfathers of AI) and asked if I could meet him and learn
about his life and perspective. To my pleasant surprise, he was happy to meet
with me. A week later I biked over to his house and had a very interesting two
hour conversation with him.McCarthy told me a lot about his career and his
transition from MIT to Stanford. What struck me the most though was what he
had to say about Lisp. Lisp was acomplete afterthoughtfor McCarthy. He just
needed a language for doing AI research, his true passion. Since the languages
available at that time were difficult to use, he created a language that he
felt would make him the most productive in his research. This reminds me a lot
about how Isaac Newton invented the tool of calculus to further his research
in gravity. Calculus transformed mathematics in its own right, and the
innovations of Lisp are still reverberating through the programming language

<p>Introduction: I used to send a job candidate an email like the following after the person
failed a phone interview:Hi [Candidate],Thanks a lot for taking the time to
interview with us. However, we've decided not to move forward in the process
with you. I wish you the best of luck on your future
projects.Best,NathanRejection emails like that are cold, impersonal, and
hollow. It doesn't feel good to send an email like that, and it sure doesn't
feel good to receive an email like that.You want a candidate to feel good
about your company even after failing the interview process. You don't want
the candidate to discourage their friends from interviewing with your company,
and ideally you want the candidate to refer their friends to your company.Now
I tell candidates on the spot whether they pass or fail at the end of the
phone interview. I give them feedback on what they did well and what they did
poorly. I'm very candid with them.The first time I tried this, I had
butterflies in my stomach. I thought to</p><p>3 0.3180061 <a title="26-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wasrecently interviewedfor "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The
interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to
see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being,
ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on
my blog. Hope you enjoy!What drew you to programming and what was the first
interesting program you wrote?I started programming when I was 10 years old on
my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted
to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class
:D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game
where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more
targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated
to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the
TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the characters 'a' throu</p><p>4 0.21837385 <a title="26-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-06-16-Your_company_has_a_knowledge_debt_problem.html">18 nathan marz storm-2010-06-16-Your company has a knowledge debt problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When your company lacks experience in tools and techniques that can make it
more productive, your company has knowledge debt.Companies tend to operate in
ways that exacerbate their knowledge debt problem. Consider this fairly
typical job ad:Initech is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to jointhe
engineering team.Responsibilities* Design core, back-end software components*
Analyze and improve efficiency, scalability, and stabilityof various system
resourcesRequirements* M.S. Computer Science or related field preferred* 2+
years of Java experience* Expert in relational data modeling and
queryoptimization using MySQLI would posit a guess that this company uses Java
for the majority of its work and uses MySQL on the back-end. Naturally, the
company wants to recruit people who share that skill set and can "jump right
in" and contribute.This mindset is fundamentally flawed. A company should be
hiring for problem solving skills, programming ability, and cultural fit, not

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a
great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how
to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to
evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the
recruitment process.Now I'm a few years out of college andI have that kick-ass
jobI was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on
the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it
takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.Here are my tips, from
preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and
getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in
the comments!Preparing for the job search1. Make a list of the qualities
you're looking for in a job. Be explicit and specific.What are you looking
for? Coworkers that are really smart that you can learn from? Coworkers that
you can sociali</p><p>6 0.19671217 <a title="26-lda-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2013/nathan_marz_storm-2013-04-12-Break_into_Silicon_Valley_with_a_blog.html">38 nathan marz storm-2013-04-12-Break into Silicon Valley with a blog</a></p>
