<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the great  MapReduce Versus Database War , you would be correct.   Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each machine approach,  to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability potential.
 
Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each individual machine.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Gordon Worley , a Software Engineer at  Korrelate , where they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline purchases. 
 
Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were originally told to expect. I wouldn’t say we panicked, but the office was certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.

This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>5 0.26049584 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Product%3A_Smart_Inspect.html">541 high scalability-2009-03-16-Product: Smart Inspect</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Smart Inspect  has added quite a few features specifically tailored to high scalability and high performance environments to our tool over the years. This includes the ability to log to memory and dump log files on demand (when a crash occurs for example), special backlog queue features, a log service application for central log storage and a lot more.

<p>Introduction: In  Log Everything All the Time  I advocate applications shouldn't bother logging at all. Why waste all that time and code? No, wait, that's not right. I preach logging everything all the time. Doh. Facebook obviously feels similarly which is why they opened sourced  Scribe , their internal logging system, capable of logging 10s of billions of messages per day. These messages include access logs, performance statistics, actions that went to News Feed, and many others.   Imagine hundreds of thousands of machines across many geographical dispersed datacenters just aching to send their precious log payload to the central repository off all knowledge. Because really, when you combine all the meta data with all the events you pretty much have a complete picture of your operations. Once in the central repository logs can be scanned, indexed, summarized, aggregated, refactored, diced, data cubed, and mined for every scrap of potentially useful information.

<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical successful website goes through: 
 
 Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture, low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers, database server, and internal storage. 
 Stage 2 - More of the same, just bigger. 
 Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding. 
 Stage 4 - The Pain Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content, significant re-architecting for DB. 
 Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters, using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster. 
 Stage 6 - Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again, op</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97709274 <a title="77-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-30-Log_Everything_All_the_Time.html">77 high scalability-2007-08-30-Log Everything All the Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This JoelOnSoftware  thread  asks the age old question of what and how to log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large scale distributed system. Instead, you need to  log everything all the time  so you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge range of servers. Yes, it can be done.  To see why the typical logging approach is broken,  imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it. Now.  So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter,  web server, database server,</p><p>3 0.97054529 <a title="77-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy%3A_Devirtualize_for_More_Vroom.html">664 high scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy: Devirtualize for More Vroom</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtualization offers a lot of benefits, but it also comes with a  cost  (memory, CPU, network, IO, licensing). If you are in or running a cloud then some form of virtualization may not even be an option. But if you are running your own string of servers you can choose to go without. Free will and all that. Should you or shouldn't you?  In a detailed comparison the folks at  37signals  found that  running their Rails application servers without virtualization  resulted in  A 66% reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is beyond what I expected .   As is common 37signals runs their big database servers without virtualization. They use a scale-up approach at the database tier so extracting every bit of performance out of those servers is key. Application servers typically use a scale-out approach for scalability, which is virtualization friendly, but that says nothing about performance.   Finding performance increases, especially when you are running on a d</p><p>4 0.97042894 <a title="77-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Have_We_Reached_the_End_of_Scaling%3F.html">758 high scalability-2010-01-11-Have We Reached the End of Scaling?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
Have we reached the end of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The End of" headlines. We've reached  The End of History  because the Western liberal democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government."  We've reached  The End of Science  because of the "fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions." We've even reached  The End of Theory  because all answers can be found in the continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're at  The End of the World ?
 
Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?
 
For a while I thought this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is because of the slow down of potential articles at m</p><p>5 0.97028589 <a title="77-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-How_Rackspace_Now_Uses_MapReduce_and_Hadoop_to_Query_Terabytes_of_Data.html">233 high scalability-2008-01-30-How Rackspace Now Uses MapReduce and Hadoop to Query Terabytes of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the great  MapReduce Versus Database War , you would be correct.   Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each machine approach,  to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability potential.
 
Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each individual machine.
