<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are
using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it
has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've
only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster,
and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will
take even longer the more files we get.What worries me is that it seems to
make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and
soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node.
It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include
the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling
strategy.We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1
as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the
DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files are

<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame
is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data
spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can
leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the
granularity of an individual file." About pNFSStorageMojosays:pNFS is going to
commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we won't know how we got along

<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>2 0.87085605 <a title="278-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-12-Gandi.net%2C_french_registrar_launches_in_granular_server_resources..html">209 high scalability-2008-01-12-Gandi.net, french registrar launches in granular server resources.</a></p>

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly
functional for most 2-tier shared nothing sites they don't need a better

<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>5 0.74204397 <a title="278-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal_Architecture.html">3 high scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A fascinating and detailed story of how LiveJournal evolved their system to
scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced
issues from quickly adding a large number of users. Blog posts come fast and
furious which causes a lot of writes and writes are particularly hard to
scale. Understanding how LiveJournal faced their scaling problems will help
