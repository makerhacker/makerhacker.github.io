<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

<p>Introduction: Plenty of Fish CEO Markus Frind, famous nerd hero for making over $10 million
a year from Google ads on a free dating site he made and ran all by himself,
nowsees a problem with the free model:The problem with free is that every time
you double the size of your database the cost of maintaining the site grows 6
fold. I really underestimated how much resources it would take, I have one
database table now that exceeds 3 billion records. The bigger you get as a
free site the less money you make per visit and the more it costs to service a
visit...There is really no money in being free and we have to start
experimenting with other models now or we won't be able to compete in 3 or 4
years.As one commenter succinctly put it: the"golden time" of AdSense is over.
Time to look at costs. The POF architecture is to run scarily huge tables on
single machines. They also buy and maintain their own SAN. So it seems scaling
up is what is increasing costs and decreasing profits. I wonder if the

the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure how many people who follow this have even tried collectl but I
wanted to let you all know that I just released a set of utilities called
strangely enough collectl-utils, which you can get athttp://collectl-
utils.sourceforge.net. One web-based utility called colplot gives you the
ability to very easily plot data from multiple systems in a way that makes
correlating them over time very easy.Another utility called colmux lets you
look at multiple systems in real time. In fact if you go the page that
describes it in more detail you'll see a photo which shows the CPU loads on
192 systems one a second, one set of data/line! in fact the display so wide it
takes 3 large monitors side-by-side to see it all and even though you can't
actually read the displays you can easily see which systems are loaded and
which aren't.Anyhow give it a look and let me know what you think.-mark</p><p>5 0.60429597 <a title="361-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-30-Creating_a_high-performing_online_database_.html">451 high scalability-2008-11-30-Creating a high-performing online database </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi there,I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of
people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to
create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but
eventually it will get there.The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of
information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's
pretty usable!What do you think I need to create a database an online database
like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design
of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.But what I need to know
is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that
fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my
users to populate the database.What programming languages you suggest?
development environment? approaches?your contribution is highly
appreciated.Regards,Jalil</p><p>6 0.5959484 <a title="361-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Application_Database_and_DAL_Architecture.html">222 high scalability-2008-01-25-Application Database and DAL Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At least in the articles on Plenty of Fish and Slashdot it was mentioned that
one can achieve higher performance by creating read-only and write-only
databases where possible.I have read the comments and tried unsuccessfully to
find more information on the net about this. I still do not understand the
concept. Can someone explain it in more detail, as well as recommend resources
for further investigation? (Are there books written specifically about this
technique?) I think it is a very important issue, because databases are
oftentimes the bottleneck.</p><p>2 0.90128976 <a title="361-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Make_Your_Site_Run_10_Times_Faster.html">261 high scalability-2008-02-25-Make Your Site Run 10 Times Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: Robert Haas in hisSURGE Recap of theSurgeconference, reflected a bit, and came
up with an interesting checklist of general themes from what he was seeing.
I'm directly quoting his post, so please see the post for a full discussion.
He uses this framework to think about the larger picture and where PostgreSQL
stands in its progression.Make use of the academic literature.Inventing your
own way to do something is fine, but at least consider the possibility that
someone smarter than you has thought about this problem before.Failures are
inevitable, so plan for them.  Try to minimize the possibility of cascading
failures, and plan in advance how you can operate in degraded mode if disaster
(or the Slashdot effect) strikes.Disk technology matters.Drive firmware bugs
are common and nightmarish, and you can expect very limited help from the
manufacturer, especially if the drive is billed as consumer-grade rather than
enterprise-grade. SSDs can save you a lot of money, both because a given

<p>Introduction: From their website:SystemImageris software that makes the installation of
Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software
distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also
be used for content distribution.SystemImager makes it easy to do automated
installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution,
configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux
machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to
another!breakIt can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By
saving your current production image before updating to your new production
image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production
enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production
image with a simple update command!Some typical environments include: Internet

and corporate desktop envir</p><p>5 0.85444313 <a title="361-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End_Performance_Study_of_Cloud_Services.html">831 high scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End Performance Study of Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-
intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding
servers if the workload increases. At theSystems Group, ETH Zurich, we did an
extensiveend-to-end performance studyto compare the major cloud offerings
regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.The
focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-
loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used theTPC-W, a standardized
benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W
defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page
requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major
modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000
simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system.
