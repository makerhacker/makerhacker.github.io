</p><p>8 1 Introduction Modem robots still lag far behind animals in their capability for legged locomotion. [sent-14, score-0.209]
</p><p>9 Fourlegged animals use distinct walking gaits [1], resulting for example in reduction of energy consumption at high speeds [5]. [sent-15, score-0.217]
</p><p>10 Similarly, the use of different gaits can allow legged robots to adjust their walking behavior not only for speed but also to the terrain they encounter. [sent-16, score-0.337]
</p><p>11 Coordinating the rhythmic movement patterns necessary for locomotion is a difficult task involving a large number of mechanical degrees of freedom (DOF) and input from many sensors, and considerable advantages may be gained by emulating control architectures found in animals. [sent-17, score-0.513]
</p><p>12 Neuroscientists have found increasingly strong evidence during the past century to support the hypothesis that centers in the nervous system, called Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), generate rhythmic output responsible for coordinating the large number of muscles needed for locomotion [2]. [sent-18, score-0.411]
</p><p>13 This architecture greatly simplifies the control problem for the brain. [sent-20, score-0.174]

</p><p>16 the complex pattern of muscle activity required to generate locomotion [3]. [sent-25, score-0.19]
</p><p>17 We make use of these biological findings by implementing a similar control architecture to control a walking machine. [sent-26, score-0.416]
</p><p>18 A neuromorphic Gait Controller (GC) chip produces time varying output voltages that control the movement of the robot's legs. [sent-27, score-0.963]
</p><p>19 Their frequency, phase relationships and duty cycles determine the resulting walking behavior (step frequency, walking gait and direction of motion) and depend on a small set of control parameters. [sent-28, score-1.043]
</p><p>20 For an ideal system, the relationship between control parameters and output voltages can be determined analytically, but deviations of the chip from ideal have to be compensated for by other means. [sent-29, score-0.846]
</p><p>21 The robot is given the specifications of the desired movement sequence and explores parameter combinations in the input parameter space of its GC chip, keeping only those leading to a movement that is correct within some tolerance. [sent-31, score-0.377]
</p><p>22 It then locates the region in input parameter space that contains most of these parameter combinations using an algorithm [7] that extends SV learning to unlabelled data. [sent-32, score-0.039]
</p><p>23 The control architecture is inspired by the architecture which is used for locomotion in vertebrates (see Fig. [sent-34, score-0.418]
</p><p>24 Like in biology, the existence of the GC chip considerably simplifies the control task. [sent-37, score-0.493]
</p><p>25 The computer only needs to set the input parameters to the GC chip, leaving the chip to coordinate the pattern of motor movements necessary to generate locomotion of the robot. [sent-38, score-0.707]
</p><p>26 The circuitry on the GC chip is based on an analysis [8] of circuits originating from M. [sent-39, score-0.403]
</p><p>27 The GC chip contains five oscillators which can be inter-connected in different ways. [sent-44, score-0.651]
</p><p>28 The chip can be used in three reasonable configurations, one of which, a chain of four oscillators (Fig. [sent-45, score-0.738]
</p><p>29 ,4} will denote the oscillator identity and subscripts k E {l, r} will denote one of the two sub-circuits within an oscillator. [sent-51, score-0.208]
</p><p>30 Here l stands for the left side of the oscillator circuit and r for the right side. [sent-52, score-0.337]
</p><p>31 Each sub-circuit has a capacitor connecting an input node to a node Vi,k, to which the input node of an inverter is connected. [sent-53, score-0.348]
</p><p>32 The output node of the inverter is called Vout,i,k. [sent-54, score-0.169]
</p><p>33 It has four DC motors which drive aluminum legs attached at right angles to the plane of the body. [sent-57, score-0.392]
</p><p>34 Each leg ends in a foot that contains a small electromagnet which is activated during the stance phase of the leg and deactivated during the swing phase. [sent-58, score-0.622]
</p><p>35 The robot walks on a metal floor so that the electromagnet increases the friction during the stance phase. [sent-61, score-0.242]

</p><p>37 The round symbols stand for oscillators numbered corresponding to the text. [sent-65, score-0.341]
</p><p>38 The thick arrows stand for the transmission gates which couple the oscillators (see circuit diagram in Fig. [sent-66, score-0.515]
</p><p>39 The arrows that lead to the four legs represent the outputs of the oscillators. [sent-68, score-0.24]
</p><p>40 Finally, a n-FET transistor with gate voltage Vb,i,k is connected between Vi,k and ground. [sent-69, score-0.207]
</p><p>41 An oscillator is obtained by connecting the input node of one sub-circuit to the output node of the other and vice versa. [sent-70, score-0.448]
</p><p>42 The output voltages of a single oscillator are two mirror-image step functions at Vout,i,l and Vout,i,r' These voltages control the stepping movements of one leg. [sent-71, score-0.885]
</p><p>43 Two oscillators, j and j + 1 (j E {I, '" 3}), are coupled with two transmission gates. [sent-72, score-0.141]
</p><p>44 The current that flows through it depends on the bias voltage Vi"j j+1,1' Likewise, the other transmission gate connects Vout,j,r and Vi+1,r and has the bias voltage Vb,j j+1 ,r' Note that the coupling is asymmetric, affecting only oscillator j + 1. [sent-74, score-0.682]
</p><p>45 The voltages at the input nodes to the inverters of oscillator j are not affected by the coupling since the inverters act as impedance buffers. [sent-75, score-0.556]
</p><p>46 The chip's output is characterized by the frequency (common to all oscillators), the four duty cycles of the oscillators and three phase lags between oscillators. [sent-76, score-0.932]
</p><p>47 The phase lags determine which gait the robot adopts. [sent-77, score-0.429]
</p><p>48 The duty cycles of the oscillators set the ratio between stance and swing phase of the legs. [sent-78, score-0.887]
</p><p>49 Certain combinations of duty cycles differing from 50% make the robot turn [8]. [sent-79, score-0.593]
</p><p>50 For a set of constant input parameters, {Vb,i,r, Vb,i,l, Vb,j j+1,r, Vb,j j+l,l}, a rhythmic output is produced with oscillation period P, duty cycles Di and phase shifts ¢j, where i E {I, ",4} and j E {I, '" 3}. [sent-80, score-0.792]
</p><p>51 Analysis of the resulting circuit reveals [8] how the output characteristics of the chip depend on the input parameters. [sent-81, score-0.555]
</p><p>52 Assume that all transistors on the chip are identical and that the peak voltages at node V1,1 and at node V1,r are identical and equal to Vmax . [sent-82, score-0.73]
</p><p>53 For a certain range of input parameters, the period of the oscillators is given by the period of the first oscillator in the chain (called the master oscillator) . [sent-83, score-0.701]
</p><p>54 Let the duty cycle be defined as the fraction of the period during which Vout,i,l is high. [sent-102, score-0.517]
</p><p>55 The master oscillator's duty cycle is  D1 = 1/[1 + ePrK. [sent-103, score-0.524]
</p><p>56 (Vb,l,r - Vb,l ,I)] (2) A very simple requirement for the controller is to produce a symmetric waveform for straight forward locomotion. [sent-104, score-0.132]
</p><p>57 For this, all oscillators must have a duty cycle of 112 (=50%) [8]. [sent-105, score-0.753]
</p><p>58 This can be implemented by a symmetric circuit (identical control voltages on both right and left side: Vb,j j+1,1 = Vb ,j j+l,r =: Vb,j j+l Vj E {I, '" 3} and Vb,i,l = Vb,i,r =: Vb,i Vi E {I, ",4}). [sent-106, score-0.482]
</p><p>59 Then the phase lag between oscillators j and j + 1 is given by (compare Fig. [sent-108, score-0.456]

</p><p>61 The gate voltage on the n-FET of each transmission gate is set to be the complementary voltage of the p-FET of the same transmission gate by the circuits which are drawn next to the transmission gates. [sent-119, score-0.738]
</p><p>62 These circuits are controlled by the bias voltages Vb ,i HI,I and Vb,i i+1 ,r and copy the voltages Vb,j+1,1 and Vb,j+1 ,r, to nodes 2 and 4, respectively, while the voltages at nodes 1 and 3 are (Vdd - Vb ,HI,I) and (Vdd - Vb,HI,r), respectively. [sent-120, score-0.788]

</p><p>65 In the real system, the duty cycle changes with the phase lag (see Fig. [sent-125, score-0.653]
</p><p>66 Thus, to obtain a duty cycle of 112, Vb ,i HI,1 might have to differfrom Vb,j HI,r . [sent-127, score-0.475]
</p><p>67 Parameter points which lead to both a desired phase lag and a duty cycle of 112 lie in a two dimensional space spanned by Vb ,j HI,I and Vb,j j+1,r. [sent-128, score-0.698]
</p><p>68 First, a subset X in this input parameter space is chosen according to the estimate given by (3). [sent-130, score-0.039]
</p><p>69 X is scanned and at each point, the output characteristics of the GC chip are determined. [sent-131, score-0.459]

</p><p>79 5 Discussion We have introduced a novel neuromorphic chip for inter-leg coordination of a walking machine. [sent-422, score-0.613]
</p><p>80 A Support Vector algorithm enables tile robotic system to learn a desired movement sequence. [sent-424, score-0.258]
</p><p>81 We have demonstrated this here using the walk gait as an example. [sent-425, score-0.187]
</p><p>82 The architecture we used reduced the learning of a complex motor behavior to a classification task. [sent-427, score-0.118]
</p><p>83 The chip need not be interfaced to a computer; it can control the robot without any need of software once the input parameters of the chip are known. [sent-429, score-1.098]
</p><p>84 Note, that the chips bias voltages can also be changed by simple sensors in a direct way, enabling the robot to adapt its behavior according to sensory information. [sent-430, score-0.535]
</p><p>85 However, the chip-computer interface creates a hybrid system in which the complex movement pattern required to make a four legged machine locomote is controlled by the chip, while algorithms run on the computer can focus on more demanding tasks. [sent-432, score-0.189]
</p><p>86 This architecture enables the robotic system to exploit the motor abilities it has due to the GC chip - independent of tile particular physical shape of the robot. [sent-433, score-0.635]
</p><p>87 The hybrid system could also be useful for the development of a second generation of neuromorphic motor control chips, able to solve more complex tasks. [sent-434, score-0.302]
</p><p>88 Furthermore, the control circuit could easily be extended to the control of six (or more) legs simply by addition of two (or more) oscillators, without increasing drastically in complexity, as the number of control parameters is small and scales linearly with the number of oscillators. [sent-435, score-0.569]
</p><p>89 Similarly, the circuit could be expanded to control n-jointed legs if each of the four oscillators becomes itself the master of a chain of n oscillators. [sent-436, score-0.743]
</p><p>90 Finally, the learning procedure introduced here could be used as a general method for fine tuning of neuromorphic aVLSI chips. [sent-437, score-0.118]

</p><p>93 The four legs are distinguished by the abbreviations: left front (LF; dots), right front (RF; circles), left hind (LH; crosses) and right hind (RH; stars). [sent-468, score-0.57]
</p><p>94 The legs move in succession with a phase shift of 90° : LF, RH, RF, and finally LH, a typical walk sequence [1]. [sent-469, score-0.276]
</p><p>95 Thus the duty cycles of the control voltages appear to deviate from 50 %. [sent-471, score-0.791]
</p><p>96 However, the data on the right proves that the duty cycles are sufficiently close to 50 % to cause the robot to walk forward in a straight line, as desired. [sent-472, score-0.742]
</p><p>97 This shows that the robot moves forward on a straight line. [sent-477, score-0.228]

<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Bradley A. Minch</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we explore homeostasis in a silicon integrate-and-fire neuron. The neuron adapts its firing rate over long time periods on the order of seconds or minutes so that it returns to its spontaneous firing rate after a lasting perturbation. Homeostasis is implemented via two schemes. One scheme looks at the presynaptic activity and adapts the synaptic weight depending on the presynaptic spiking rate.

<p>Author: Susanne Still, Bernhard Schölkopf, Klaus Hepp, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: To control the walking gaits of a four-legged robot we present a novel neuromorphic VLSI chip that coordinates the relative phasing of the robot's legs similar to how spinal Central Pattern Generators are believed to control vertebrate locomotion [3]. The chip controls the leg movements by driving motors with time varying voltages which are the outputs of a small network of coupled oscillators. The characteristics of the chip's output voltages depend on a set of input parameters. The relationship between input parameters and output voltages can be computed analytically for an idealized system. In practice, however, this ideal relationship is only approximately true due to transistor mismatch and offsets. Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning algorithm introduced recently [7]. The learning requires only that the description of the desired output is given. The machine learns from (unlabeled) examples how to set the parameters to the chip in order to obtain a desired motor behavior.</p><p>2 0.55332875 <a title="57-lsi-2" href="./nips-2000-Smart_Vision_Chip_Fabricated_Using_Three_Dimensional_Integration_Technology.html">118 nips-2000-Smart Vision Chip Fabricated Using Three Dimensional Integration Technology</a></p>

We have designed and fabricated an 11transistor primitive, that we term an automaximizing bump circuit, that implements competitive learning dynamics.

We show that our primitive is suitable for implementing competitive learning in VLSI, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a standard clustering task.</p><p>4 0.45820692 <a title="57-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-Bayes_Networks_on_Ice%3A_Robotic_Search_for_Antarctic_Meteorites.html">29 nips-2000-Bayes Networks on Ice: Robotic Search for Antarctic Meteorites</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Tong, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks are graphical representations of probability distributions. In virtually all of the work on learning these networks, the assumption is that we are presented with a data set consisting of randomly generated instances from the underlying distribution. In many situations, however, we also have the option of active learning, where we have the possibility of guiding the sampling process by querying for certain types of samples. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the parameters of Bayesian networks in an active learning setting. We provide a theoretical framework for this problem, and an algorithm that chooses which active learning queries to generate based on the model learned so far. We present experimental results showing that our active learning algorithm can significantly reduce the need for training data in many situations.</p><p>4 0.26294923 <a title="57-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>5 0.2598443 <a title="57-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Automatic_Choice_of_Dimensionality_for_PCA.html">27 nips-2000-Automatic Choice of Dimensionality for PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas P. Minka</p><p>Abstract: A central issue in principal component analysis (PCA) is choosing the number of principal components to be retained. By interpreting PCA as density estimation, we show how to use Bayesian model selection to estimate the true dimensionality of the data. The resulting estimate is simple to compute yet guaranteed to pick the correct dimensionality, given enough data. The estimate involves an integral over the Steifel manifold of k-frames, which is difficult to compute exactly. But after choosing an appropriate parameterization and applying Laplace's method, an accurate and practical estimator is obtained. In simulations, it is convincingly better than cross-validation and other proposed algorithms, plus it runs much faster.</p><p>6 0.25496599 <a title="57-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-What_Can_a_Single_Neuron_Compute%3F.html">146 nips-2000-What Can a Single Neuron Compute?</a></p>
