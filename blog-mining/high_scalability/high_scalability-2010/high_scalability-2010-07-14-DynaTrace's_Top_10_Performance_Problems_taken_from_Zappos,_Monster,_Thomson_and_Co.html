<p>Introduction: Production Monitoringis about ensuring the stability and health of our system,
that also includes the application. A lot of times we encounter production
systems that concentrate on System Monitoring, under the assumption that a
stable system leads to stable and healthy applications. So let's see what
System Monitoring can tell us about ourApplication.Let's take a very simple
two tier Web Application: This is a simple multi-tier eCommerce solution.
Users are concerned about bad performance when they do a search. Let's see
what we can find out about it if performance is not satisfactory. We start by
looking at a couple of simple metrics.CPU UtilizationThe best known operating
system metric is CPU utilization, but it is also the most misunderstood. This
metric tells us how much time the CPU spent executing code in the last
interval and how much more it could execute theoretically. Like all other
utilization measures it tells us something about the capacity, but not about

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,
rerouting is a high priority activity. If there is a large amount of rerouting

<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage
production: 207.11 vs 41.81 MiB/sThe buffer pool is much faster than JVM as
the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how

<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because t</p><p>6 0.11907198 <a title="859-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.
Cause was a priority invers</p><p>4 0.76169491 <a title="859-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-When_optimizing_-_don%27t_forget_the_Java_Virtual_Machine_%28JVM%29_.html">701 high scalability-2009-09-10-When optimizing - don't forget the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was
related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce
the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and
was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read,
write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most
costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.The
project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one
question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase
performance?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/08/jvm-

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>6 0.7334429 <a title="859-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-16-Big_List_of_20_Common_Bottlenecks.html">1246 high scalability-2012-05-16-Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and JeffAtwood areraising VC moneyforStackOverflow.This is
interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small
and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different
direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space
and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most
importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh
and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your
ambition, and go for VC money. Please seeJoel's blogpost for the details, but
here's when to go VC:There's a land grab going on.There is a provable concept
that's repeatable.The business itself could benefit from the publicity.The
investor will add substantial value to the business.The business can
potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company.The
founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.Joel thinks

<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker Newsthread, commenting on a 37signals
interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal
number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin
administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three
admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of
always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next
emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three
admins you can:Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off
being on call.Not be on call all the time.A larger shop will naturally have
more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to
minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be
something to consider.</p><p>3 0.83705008 <a title="859-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and
using i</p><p>4 0.82850182 <a title="859-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-22-Paper%3A_On_Delivering_Embarrassingly_Distributed_Cloud_Services.html">387 high scalability-2008-09-22-Paper: On Delivering Embarrassingly Distributed Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we scale datacenters? Should we build a few mammoth million machine
datacenters or many smaller micro datacenters? Intuitively we usually go with
a bigger is better economies of scale type argument, but it may not be so.
What works for Walmart may not work for White Box World. Mega datacenters may
actually exhibit diseconomies of scale. It may be better to run applications
over many distributed micro datacenters instead of one large one.This paper by
Ken Church, Albert Greenberg, and James Hamilton, all from Microsoft, takes a
look at the different issues and concludes:Putting it all together, the micro
model offers a design point with attractive performance, reliability, scale
and cost. Given how much the industry is currently investing in the mega
model, the industry would do well to consider the micro alternative. break

Many Database Calls- too many database query per
request/transaction.Synchronized to Death- in a high-load or production
environment over-synchronization results in severe performance and scalability
problems.Too chatty on the remoting channels- too many calls across these
remoting boundaries and in the end causes performance and scalability
problems.Wrong usage of O/R-Mappers- incorrect usage of the framework itself
too often results in unexpected performance and scalability problems within
these frameworks.Memory Leaks- GC does not prevent memory leaks, it is
important to release object references as soon as they are no longer
needed.Problematic 3rd Party Code/Components- check of every framework before
