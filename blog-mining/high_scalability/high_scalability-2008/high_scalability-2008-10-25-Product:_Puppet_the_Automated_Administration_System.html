<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by LogicMonitor's Director of Tech Ops,Jesse Aukeman,
about the different ways they're monitoring the success or failure of Puppet
runs.If you are like us, you are running some type of linux configuration
management tool. The value of centralized configuration and deployment is well
known and hard to overstate. Puppetis our tool of choice. It is powerful and
works well for us, except when things don't go as planned. Failures of puppet
can be innocuous and cosmetic, or they can cause production issues, for
example when crucial updates do not get properly propagated.Why?In the most
innocuous cases, the puppet agent craps out (we run puppet agent via cron). As
nice as puppet is, we still need to goose it from time to time to get past
some sort of network or host resource issue. A more dangerous case is when an
administrator temporarily disables puppet runs on a host in order to perform
some test or administrative task and then forgets to reenable it. In either
case it</p><p>3 0.26893693 <a title="429-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-13-Automation_on_AWS_with_Ruby_and_Puppet.html">1058 high scalability-2011-06-13-Automation on AWS with Ruby and Puppet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management. I will therefore</p><p>6 0.15085155 <a title="429-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle_-_Provisioning_Tool_to_Build_Remote_Servers.html">461 high scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle - Provisioning Tool to Build Remote Servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>3 0.79646194 <a title="429-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>

deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>4 0.7788837 <a title="429-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-19-Puppet_monitoring%3A_how_to_monitor_the_success_or_failure_of_Puppet_runs__.html">1408 high scalability-2013-02-19-Puppet monitoring: how to monitor the success or failure of Puppet runs  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by LogicMonitor's Director of Tech Ops,Jesse Aukeman,
about the different ways they're monitoring the success or failure of Puppet
runs.If you are like us, you are running some type of linux configuration
management tool. The value of centralized configuration and deployment is well
known and hard to overstate. Puppetis our tool of choice. It is powerful and
works well for us, except when things don't go as planned. Failures of puppet
can be innocuous and cosmetic, or they can cause production issues, for
example when crucial updates do not get properly propagated.Why?In the most
innocuous cases, the puppet agent craps out (we run puppet agent via cron). As
nice as puppet is, we still need to goose it from time to time to get past
some sort of network or host resource issue. A more dangerous case is when an
administrator temporarily disables puppet runs on a host in order to perform
some test or administrative task and then forgets to reenable it. In either
case it</p><p>5 0.77285641 <a title="429-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>6 0.77180171 <a title="429-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-09-Vagrant_-_Build_and_Deploy_Virtualized_Development_Environments_Using_Ruby.html">807 high scalability-2010-04-09-Vagrant - Build and Deploy Virtualized Development Environments Using Ruby</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to

It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your

<p>Introduction: If you are aninsect, don't work at TripAdvisor, specialization is out. One of
the most commented on strategies from theTripAdvisor architecture article is
their rather opinionated take on the role of engineers in the
organization.Typically engineers live in a box. They are specialized, they do
database work and not much else, and they just do programming, not much else.
TripAdvisor takes the road less traveled:Engineers work across entire stack-
HTML, CSS, JS, Java, scripting. If you do not know something, you learn it.
The only thing that gets in the way of delivering your project is you, as you
are expected to work at all levels - design, code, test, monitoring, CSS, JS,
Java, SQL, scripting.We do not have "architects."  At TripAdvisor, if you
design something, your code it, and if you code it you test it. Engineers who
do not like to go outside their comfort zone, or who feel certain work is
"beneath" them will simply get in the way.A radical take for an established
organization. We</p><p>4 0.90988141 <a title="429-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing_NoSQL_and_Relational_Data_Storage%3A_MySQL_with_MongoDB.html">872 high scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing NoSQL and Relational Data Storage: MySQL with MongoDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that

you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off

he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>6 0.85842979 <a title="429-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-01-Khan_Academy_Checkbook_Scaling_to_6_Million_Users_a_Month_on_GAE.html">1432 high scalability-2013-04-01-Khan Academy Checkbook Scaling to 6 Million Users a Month on GAE</a></p>
