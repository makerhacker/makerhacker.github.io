<p>Author: Lonneke van der Plas ; Paola Merlo ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: Broad-coverage semantic annotations for training statistical learners are only available for a handful of languages. Previous approaches to cross-lingual transfer of semantic annotations have addressed this problem with encouraging results on a small scale. In this paper, we scale up previous efforts by using an automatic approach to semantic annotation that does not rely on a semantic ontology for the target language. Moreover, we improve the quality of the transferred semantic annotations by using a joint syntacticsemantic parser that learns the correlations between syntax and semantics of the target language and smooths out the errors from automatic transfer. We reach a labelled F-measure for predicates and arguments of only 4% and 9% points, respectively, lower than the upper bound from manual annotations.</p><p>4 0.052309044 <a title="138-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-Disambiguating_temporal-contrastive_connectives_for_machine_translation.html">96 acl-2011-Disambiguating temporal-contrastive connectives for machine translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Meyer</p><p>Abstract: Temporal–contrastive discourse connectives (although, while, since, etc.) signal various types ofrelations between clauses such as temporal, contrast, concession and cause. They are often ambiguous and therefore difficult to translate from one language to another. We discuss several new and translation-oriented experiments for the disambiguation of a specific subset of discourse connectives in order to correct some of the translation errors made by current statistical machine translation systems.</p><p>5 0.042797014 <a title="138-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Clustering_Comparable_Corpora_For_Bilingual_Lexicon_Extraction.html">70 acl-2011-Clustering Comparable Corpora For Bilingual Lexicon Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Li ; Eric Gaussier ; Akiko Aizawa</p><p>Abstract: We study in this paper the problem of enhancing the comparability of bilingual corpora in order to improve the quality of bilingual lexicons extracted from comparable corpora. We introduce a clustering-based approach for enhancing corpus comparability which exploits the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and finally preserves most of the vocabulary of the original corpus. Our experiments illustrate the well-foundedness of this method and show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from the homogeneous corpus are of better quality than the lexicons obtained with previous approaches.</p><p>6 0.039771054 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Monolingual_Alignment_by_Edit_Rate_Computation_on_Sentential_Paraphrase_Pairs.html">225 acl-2011-Monolingual Alignment by Edit Rate Computation on Sentential Paraphrase Pairs</a></p>

MACAON has been designed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several native modules for common tasks such as a tokenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntactic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML files . In addition, exchange protocols with external tools are easily definable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, distributed under GNU Public License.</p><p>6 0.40365013 <a title="138-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Interface_for_Rapid_Natural_Language_Processing_Development_in_UIMA.html">42 acl-2011-An Interface for Rapid Natural Language Processing Development in UIMA</a></p>

<p>Author: Hongning Wang ; Duo Zhang ; ChengXiang Zhai</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have been successfully applied to many document analysis tasks to discover topics embedded in text. However, existing topic models generally cannot capture the latent topical structures in documents. Since languages are intrinsically cohesive and coherent, modeling and discovering latent topical transition structures within documents would be beneficial for many text analysis tasks. In this work, we propose a new topic model, Structural Topic Model, which simultaneously discovers topics and reveals the latent topical structures in text through explicitly modeling topical transitions with a latent first-order Markov chain. Experiment results show that the proposed Structural Topic Model can effectively discover topical structures in text, and the identified structures significantly improve the performance of tasks such as sentence annotation and sentence ordering. ,</p><p>3 0.43288136 <a title="138-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Scaling_up_Automatic_Cross-Lingual_Semantic_Role_Annotation.html">269 acl-2011-Scaling up Automatic Cross-Lingual Semantic Role Annotation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lonneke van der Plas ; Paola Merlo ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: Broad-coverage semantic annotations for training statistical learners are only available for a handful of languages. Previous approaches to cross-lingual transfer of semantic annotations have addressed this problem with encouraging results on a small scale. In this paper, we scale up previous efforts by using an automatic approach to semantic annotation that does not rely on a semantic ontology for the target language. Moreover, we improve the quality of the transferred semantic annotations by using a joint syntacticsemantic parser that learns the correlations between syntax and semantics of the target language and smooths out the errors from automatic transfer. We reach a labelled F-measure for predicates and arguments of only 4% and 9% points, respectively, lower than the upper bound from manual annotations.</p><p>4 0.34359029 <a title="138-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-A_Pilot_Study_of_Opinion_Summarization_in_Conversations.html">21 acl-2011-A Pilot Study of Opinion Summarization in Conversations</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong Wang ; Yang Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a pilot study of opinion summarization on conversations. We create a corpus containing extractive and abstractive summaries of speaker’s opinion towards a given topic using 88 telephone conversations. We adopt two methods to perform extractive summarization. The first one is a sentence-ranking method that linearly combines scores measured from different aspects including topic relevance, subjectivity, and sentence importance. The second one is a graph-based method, which incorporates topic and sentiment information, as well as additional information about sentence-to-sentence relations extracted based on dialogue structure. Our evaluation results show that both methods significantly outperform the baseline approach that extracts the longest utterances. In particular, we find that incorporating dialogue structure in the graph-based method contributes to the improved system performance.</p><p>5 0.27045572 <a title="138-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Discovering_Sociolinguistic_Associations_with_Structured_Sparsity.html">97 acl-2011-Discovering Sociolinguistic Associations with Structured Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Eisenstein ; Noah A. Smith ; Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to discover robust and interpretable sociolinguistic associations from raw geotagged text data. Using aggregate demographic statistics about the authors’ geographic communities, we solve a multi-output regression problem between demographics and lexical frequencies. By imposing a composite ‘1,∞ regularizer, we obtain structured sparsity, driving entire rows of coefficients to zero. We perform two regression studies. First, we use term frequencies to predict demographic attributes; our method identifies a compact set of words that are strongly associated with author demographics. Next, we conjoin demographic attributes into features, which we use to predict term frequencies. The composite regularizer identifies a small number of features, which correspond to communities of authors united by shared demographic and linguistic properties.</p><p>6 0.2664147 <a title="138-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Language-Independent_Parsing_with_Empty_Elements.html">192 acl-2011-Language-Independent Parsing with Empty Elements</a></p>
