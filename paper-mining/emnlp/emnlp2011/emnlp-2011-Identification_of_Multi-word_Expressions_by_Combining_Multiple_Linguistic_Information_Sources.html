<p>Author: Spence Green ; Marie-Catherine de Marneffe ; John Bauer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Multiword expressions (MWE), a known nuisance for both linguistics and NLP, blur the lines between syntax and semantics. Previous work on MWE identification has relied primarily on surface statistics, which perform poorly for longer MWEs and cannot model discontinuous expressions. To address these problems, we show that even the simplest parsing models can effectively identify MWEs of arbitrary length, and that Tree Substitution Grammars achieve the best results. Our experiments show a 36.4% F1 absolute improvement for French over an n-gram surface statistics baseline, currently the predominant method for MWE identification. Our models are useful for several NLP tasks in which MWE pre-grouping has improved accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.07365863 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Discovering_Morphological_Paradigms_from_Plain_Text_Using_a_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Model.html">39 emnlp-2011-Discovering Morphological Paradigms from Plain Text Using a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Markus Dreyer ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: We present an inference algorithm that organizes observed words (tokens) into structured inflectional paradigms (types). It also naturally predicts the spelling of unobserved forms that are missing from these paradigms, and discovers inflectional principles (grammar) that generalize to wholly unobserved words. Our Bayesian generative model of the data explicitly represents tokens, types, inflections, paradigms, and locally conditioned string edits. It assumes that inflected word tokens are generated from an infinite mixture of inflectional paradigms (string tuples). Each paradigm is sampled all at once from a graphical model, whose potential functions are weighted finitestate transducers with language-specific parameters to be learned. These assumptions naturally lead to an elegant empirical Bayes inference procedure that exploits Monte Carlo EM, belief propagation, and dynamic programming. Given 50–100 seed paradigms, adding a 10million-word corpus reduces prediction error for morphological inflections by up to 10%.</p><p>4 0.06208628 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Dahlmeier ; Hwee Tou Ng</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach for automatic collocation error correction in learner English which is based on paraphrases extracted from parallel corpora. Our key assumption is that collocation errors are often caused by semantic similarity in the first language (L1language) of the writer. An analysis of a large corpus of annotated learner English confirms this assumption. We evaluate our approach on real-world learner data and show that L1-induced paraphrases outperform traditional approaches based on edit distance, homophones, and WordNet synonyms.</p><p>5 0.055709243 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Bayesian_Mixture_Model_for_PoS_Induction_Using_Multiple_Features.html">1 emnlp-2011-A Bayesian Mixture Model for PoS Induction Using Multiple Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Christodoulopoulos ; Sharon Goldwater ; Mark Steedman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a fully unsupervised syntactic class induction system formulated as a Bayesian multinomial mixture model, where each word type is constrained to belong to a single class. By using a mixture model rather than a sequence model (e.g., HMM), we are able to easily add multiple kinds of features, including those at both the type level (morphology features) and token level (context and alignment features, the latter from parallel corpora). Using only context features, our system yields results comparable to state-of-the art, far better than a similar model without the one-class-per-type constraint. Using the additional features provides added benefit, and our final system outperforms the best published results on most of the 25 corpora tested.</p><p>6 0.055471592 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Cascaded_Classification_Approach_to_Semantic_Head_Recognition.html">2 emnlp-2011-A Cascaded Classification Approach to Semantic Head Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Lukas Michelbacher ; Alok Kothari ; Martin Forst ; Christina Lioma ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: Most NLP systems use tokenization as part of preprocessing. Generally, tokenizers are based on simple heuristics and do not recognize multi-word units (MWUs) like hot dog or black hole unless a precompiled list of MWUs is available. In this paper, we propose a new cascaded model for detecting MWUs of arbitrary length for tokenization, focusing on noun phrases in the physics domain. We adopt a classification approach because unlike other work on MWUs – tokenization requires a completely automatic approach. We achieve an accuracy of 68% for recognizing non-compositional MWUs and show that our MWU recognizer improves retrieval performance when used as part of an information retrieval system. – 1</p><p>5 0.13601203 <a title="69-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Approximate_Scalable_Bounded_Space_Sketch_for_Large_Data_NLP.html">19 emnlp-2011-Approximate Scalable Bounded Space Sketch for Large Data NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Goyal ; Hal Daume III</p><p>Abstract: We exploit sketch techniques, especially the Count-Min sketch, a memory, and time efficient framework which approximates the frequency of a word pair in the corpus without explicitly storing the word pair itself. These methods use hashing to deal with massive amounts of streaming text. We apply CountMin sketch to approximate word pair counts and exhibit their effectiveness on three important NLP tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that on all of the three tasks, we get performance comparable to Exact word pair counts setting and state-of-the-art system. Our method scales to 49 GB of unzipped web data using bounded space of 2 billion counters (8 GB memory).</p><p>6 0.12625206 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Correcting_Semantic_Collocation_Errors_with_L1-induced_Paraphrases.html">35 emnlp-2011-Correcting Semantic Collocation Errors with L1-induced Paraphrases</a></p>

<p>Author: Anna Kazantseva ; Stan Szpakowicz</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for linear text segmentation. It is an adaptation of Affinity Propagation, a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm in the framework of factor graphs. Affinity Propagation for Segmentation, or APS, receives a set of pairwise similarities between data points and produces segment boundaries and segment centres data points which best describe all other data points within the segment. APS iteratively passes messages in a cyclic factor graph, until convergence. Each iteration works with information on all available similarities, resulting in highquality results. APS scales linearly for realistic segmentation tasks. We derive the algorithm from the original Affinity Propagation formu– lation, and evaluate its performance on topical text segmentation in comparison with two state-of-the art segmenters. The results suggest that APS performs on par with or outperforms these two very competitive baselines.</p><p>2 0.67985541 <a title="69-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-A_Model_of_Discourse_Predictions_in_Human_Sentence_Processing.html">8 emnlp-2011-A Model of Discourse Predictions in Human Sentence Processing</a></p>

Both models are fully incremental and generative, giving probabilities of lexical elements conditional upon linguistic structure. This allows us to compute the information theoretic measure of surprisal, which is known to correlate with human processing effort. We evaluate our surprisal predictions on the Dundee corpus of eye-movement data show that our model achieve a better fit with human reading times than a syntax-only model which does not have access to co-reference information.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.64965254 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Identification_of_Multi-word_Expressions_by_Combining_Multiple_Linguistic_Information_Sources.html">69 emnlp-2011-Identification of Multi-word Expressions by Combining Multiple Linguistic Information Sources</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Socher ; Jeffrey Pennington ; Eric H. Huang ; Andrew Y. Ng ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning framework based on recursive autoencoders for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distributions. Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model’s ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines.</p><p>5 0.45919701 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Non-parametric_Bayesian_Segmentation_of_Japanese_Noun_Phrases.html">99 emnlp-2011-Non-parametric Bayesian Segmentation of Japanese Noun Phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Yugo Murawaki ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: A key factor of high quality word segmentation for Japanese is a high-coverage dictionary, but it is costly to manually build such a lexical resource. Although external lexical resources for human readers are potentially good knowledge sources, they have not been utilized due to differences in segmentation criteria. To supplement a morphological dictionary with these resources, we propose a new task of Japanese noun phrase segmentation. We apply non-parametric Bayesian language models to segment each noun phrase in these resources according to the statistical behavior of its supposed constituents in text. For inference, we propose a novel block sampling procedure named hybrid type-based sampling, which has the ability to directly escape a local optimum that is not too distant from the global optimum. Experiments show that the proposed method efficiently corrects the initial segmentation given by a morphological ana- lyzer.</p><p>6 0.45767778 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Generating_Subsequent_Reference_in_Shared_Visual_Scenes%3A_Computation_vs_Re-Use.html">62 emnlp-2011-Generating Subsequent Reference in Shared Visual Scenes: Computation vs Re-Use</a></p>
