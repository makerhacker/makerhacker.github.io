<p>Author: Florian Boudin ; Jian-Yun Nie ; Martin Dawes</p><p>Abstract: The PECO framework is a knowledge representation for formulating clinical questions. Queries are decomposed into four aspects, which are Patient-Problem (P), Exposure (E), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). However, no test collection is available to evaluate such framework in information retrieval. In this work, we first present the construction of a large test collection extracted from systematic literature reviews. We then describe an analysis of the distribution of PECO elements throughout the relevant documents and propose a language modeling approach that uses these distributions as a weighting strategy. In our experiments carried out on a collection of 1.5 million documents and 423 queries, our method was found to lead to an improvement of 28% in MAP and 50% in P@5, as com- pared to the state-of-the-art method.</p><p>3 0.073174559 <a title="15-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Unsupervised_Discovery_of_Negative_Categories_in_Lexicon_Bootstrapping.html">112 emnlp-2010-Unsupervised Discovery of Negative Categories in Lexicon Bootstrapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Tara McIntosh</p><p>Abstract: Multi-category bootstrapping algorithms were developed to reduce semantic drift. By extracting multiple semantic lexicons simultaneously, a category’s search space may be restricted. The best results have been achieved through reliance on manually crafted negative categories. Unfortunately, identifying these categories is non-trivial, and their use shifts the unsupervised bootstrapping paradigm towards a supervised framework. We present NEG-FINDER, the first approach for discovering negative categories automatically. NEG-FINDER exploits unsupervised term clustering to generate multiple negative categories during bootstrapping. Our algorithm effectively removes the necessity of manual intervention and formulation of negative categories, with performance closely approaching that obtained using negative categories defined by a domain expert.</p><p>4 0.070044957 <a title="15-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Negative_Training_Data_Can_be_Harmful_to_Text_Classification.html">85 emnlp-2010-Negative Training Data Can be Harmful to Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiao-Li Li ; Bing Liu ; See-Kiong Ng</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the effects of training data on binary text classification and postulates that negative training data is not needed and may even be harmful for the task. Traditional binary classification involves building a classifier using labeled positive and negative training examples. The classifier is then applied to classify test instances into positive and negative classes. A fundamental assumption is that the training and test data are identically distributed. However, this assumption may not hold in practice. In this paper, we study a particular problem where the positive data is identically distributed but the negative data may or may not be so. Many practical text classification and retrieval applications fit this model. We argue that in this setting negative training data should not be used, and that PU learning can be employed to solve the problem. Empirical evaluation has been con- ducted to support our claim. This result is important as it may fundamentally change the current binary classification paradigm.</p><p>5 0.064240374 <a title="15-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Utilizing_Extra-Sentential_Context_for_Parsing.html">118 emnlp-2010-Utilizing Extra-Sentential Context for Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Jackie Chi Kit Cheung ; Gerald Penn</p><p>Abstract: Syntactic consistency is the preference to reuse a syntactic construction shortly after its appearance in a discourse. We present an analysis of the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, and show that syntactic consistency is pervasive across productions with various lefthand side nonterminals. Then, we implement a reranking constituent parser that makes use of extra-sentential context in its feature set. Using a linear-chain conditional random field, we improve parsing accuracy over the generative baseline parser on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus, rivalling a similar model that does not make use of context. We show that the context-aware and the context-ignorant rerankers perform well on different subsets of the evaluation data, suggesting a combined approach would provide further improvement. We also compare parses made by models, and suggest that context can be useful for parsing by capturing structural dependencies between sentences as opposed to lexically governed dependencies.</p><p>6 0.061543014 <a title="15-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-What_a_Parser_Can_Learn_from_a_Semantic_Role_Labeler_and_Vice_Versa.html">121 emnlp-2010-What a Parser Can Learn from a Semantic Role Labeler and Vice Versa</a></p>

<p>Author: Ekaterina Buyko ; Udo Hahn</p><p>Abstract: In state-of-the-art approaches to information extraction (IE), dependency graphs constitute the fundamental data structure for syntactic structuring and subsequent knowledge elicitation from natural language documents. The top-performing systems in the BioNLP 2009 Shared Task on Event Extraction all shared the idea to use dependency structures generated by a variety of parsers either directly or in some converted manner — and optionally modified their output to fit the special needs of IE. As there are systematic differences between various dependency representations being used in this competition, we scrutinize on different encoding styles for dependency information and their possible impact on solving several IE tasks. After assessing more or less established dependency representations such as the Stanford and CoNLL-X dependen— cies, we will then focus on trimming operations that pave the way to more effective IE. Our evaluation study covers data from a number of constituency- and dependency-based parsers and provides experimental evidence which dependency representations are particularly beneficial for the event extraction task. Based on empirical findings from our study we were able to achieve the performance of 57.2% F-score on the development data set of the BioNLP Shared Task 2009.</p><p>5 0.26805732 <a title="15-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Negative_Training_Data_Can_be_Harmful_to_Text_Classification.html">85 emnlp-2010-Negative Training Data Can be Harmful to Text Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Limin Yao ; Sebastian Riedel ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to relation extraction that integrates information across documents, performs global inference and requires no labelled text. In particular, we tackle relation extraction and entity identification jointly. We use distant supervision to train a factor graph model for relation extraction based on an existing knowledge base (Freebase, derived in parts from Wikipedia). For inference we run an efficient Gibbs sampler that leads to linear time joint inference. We evaluate our approach both for an indomain (Wikipedia) and a more realistic outof-domain (New York Times Corpus) setting. For the in-domain setting, our joint model leads to 4% higher precision than an isolated local approach, but has no advantage over a pipeline. For the out-of-domain data, we benefit strongly from joint modelling, and observe improvements in precision of 13% over the pipeline, and 15% over the isolated baseline.</p><p>3 0.78355223 <a title="15-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Uptraining_for_Accurate_Deterministic_Question_Parsing.html">115 emnlp-2010-Uptraining for Accurate Deterministic Question Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Slav Petrov ; Pi-Chuan Chang ; Michael Ringgaard ; Hiyan Alshawi</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracies drop significantly on out-of-domain data. What is less known is that some parsers suffer more from domain shifts than others. We show that dependency parsers have more difficulty parsing questions than constituency parsers. In particular, deterministic shift-reduce dependency parsers, which are of highest interest for practical applications because of their linear running time, drop to 60% labeled accuracy on a question test set. We propose an uptraining procedure in which a deterministic parser is trained on the output of a more accurate, but slower, latent variable constituency parser (converted to dependencies). Uptraining with 100K unlabeled questions achieves results comparable to having 2K labeled questions for training. With 100K unlabeled and 2K labeled questions, uptraining is able to improve parsing accuracy to 84%, closing the gap between in-domain and out-of-domain performance.</p><p>4 0.69937897 <a title="15-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-What_a_Parser_Can_Learn_from_a_Semantic_Role_Labeler_and_Vice_Versa.html">121 emnlp-2010-What a Parser Can Learn from a Semantic Role Labeler and Vice Versa</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Boxwell ; Dennis Mehay ; Chris Brew</p><p>Abstract: In many NLP systems, there is a unidirectional flow of information in which a parser supplies input to a semantic role labeler. In this paper, we build a system that allows information to flow in both directions. We make use of semantic role predictions in choosing a single-best parse. This process relies on an averaged perceptron model to distinguish likely semantic roles from erroneous ones. Our system penalizes parses that give rise to low-scoring semantic roles. To explore the consequences of this we perform two experiments. First, we use a baseline generative model to produce n-best parses, which are then re-ordered by our semantic model. Second, we use a modified version of our semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time. The performance of this modified labeler is weaker than that of our best full SRL, because it is restricted to features that can be computed directly from the parser’s packed chart. For both experiments, the resulting semantic predictions are then used to select parses. Finally, we feed the selected parses produced by each experiment to the full version of our semantic role labeler. We find that SRL performance can be improved over this baseline by selecting parses with likely semantic roles.</p><p>5 0.51267785 <a title="15-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Function-Based_Question_Classification_for_General_QA.html">51 emnlp-2010-Function-Based Question Classification for General QA</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Bu ; Xingwei Zhu ; Yu Hao ; Xiaoyan Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In contrast with the booming increase of internet data, state-of-art QA (question answering) systems, otherwise, concerned data from specific domains or resources such as search engine snippets, online forums and Wikipedia in a somewhat isolated way. Users may welcome a more general QA system for its capability to answer questions of various sources, integrated from existed specialized sub-QA engines. In this framework, question classification is the primary task. However, the current paradigms of question classification were focused on some specified type of questions, i.e. factoid questions, which are inappropriate for the general QA. In this paper, we propose a new question classification paradigm, which includes a question taxonomy suitable to the general QA and a question classifier based on MLN (Markov logic network), where rule-based methods and statistical methods are unified into a single framework in a fuzzy discriminative learning approach. Experiments show that our method outperforms traditional question classification approaches.</p><p>6 0.47381264 <a title="15-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Discovery_of_Manner_Relations_and_its_Applications.html">21 emnlp-2010-Automatic Discovery of Manner Relations and its Applications</a></p>
