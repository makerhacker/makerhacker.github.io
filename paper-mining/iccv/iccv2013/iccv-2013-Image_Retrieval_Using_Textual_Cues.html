<p>Author: Basura Fernando, Tinne Tuytelaars</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new method for object retrieval starting from multiple query images. The use of multiple queries allows for a more expressive formulation of the query object including, e.g., different viewpoints and/or viewing conditions. This, in turn, leads to more diverse and more accurate retrieval results. When no query images are available to the user, they can easily be retrieved from the internet using a standard image search engine. In particular, we propose a new method based on pattern mining. Using the minimal description length principle, we derive the most suitable set of patterns to describe the query object, with patterns corresponding to local feature configurations. This results in apowerful object-specific mid-level image representation. The archive can then be searched efficiently for similar images based on this representation, using a combination of two inverted file systems. Since the patterns already encode local spatial information, good results on several standard image retrieval datasets are obtained even without costly re-ranking based on geometric verification.</p><p>3 0.26570648 <a title="210-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware_Co-indexing_for_Image_Retrieval.html">378 iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware Co-indexing for Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiliang Zhang, Ming Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Yuanqing Lin, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexes in image retrieval not only allow fast access to database images but also summarize all knowledge about the database, so that their discriminative capacity largely determines the retrieval performance. In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query. Experiments and comparisons with recent retrieval methods on 3 datasets, i.e., UKbench, Holidays, Oxford5K, and 1.3 million images from Flickr as distractors, manifest the competitive performance of our method 1.</p><p>4 0.25646922 <a title="210-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Subspace_Search_via_Grassmannian_Based_Hashing.html">162 iccv-2013-Fast Subspace Search via Grassmannian Based Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Xu Wang, Stefan Atev, John Wright, Gilad Lerman</p><p>Abstract: The problem of efficiently deciding which of a database of models is most similar to a given input query arises throughout modern computer vision. Motivated by applications in recognition, image retrieval and optimization, there has been significant recent interest in the variant of this problem in which the database models are linear subspaces and the input is either a point or a subspace. Current approaches to this problem have poor scaling in high dimensions, and may not guarantee sublinear query complexity. We present a new approach to approximate nearest subspace search, based on a simple, new locality sensitive hash for subspaces. Our approach allows point-tosubspace query for a database of subspaces of arbitrary dimension d, in a time that depends sublinearly on the number of subspaces in the database. The query complexity of our algorithm is linear in the ambient dimension D, allow- ing it to be directly applied to high-dimensional imagery data. Numerical experiments on model problems in image repatching and automatic face recognition confirm the advantages of our algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.2533026 <a title="210-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Offline_Mobile_Instance_Retrieval_with_a_Small_Memory_Footprint.html">294 iccv-2013-Offline Mobile Instance Retrieval with a Small Memory Footprint</a></p>
<p>Author: Jayaguru Panda, Michael S. Brown, C.V. Jawahar</p><p>Abstract: Existing mobile image instance retrieval applications assume a network-based usage where image features are sent to a server to query an online visual database. In this scenario, there are no restrictions on the size of the visual database. This paper, however, examines how to perform this same task offline, where the entire visual index must reside on the mobile device itself within a small memory footprint. Such solutions have applications on location recognition and product recognition. Mobile instance retrieval requires a significant reduction in the visual index size. To achieve this, we describe a set of strategies that can reduce the visual index up to 60-80 compared to a scatannd raerddu iens tthaen vceis rueatrli ienvdaelx xim upple tom 6en0t-8at0io ×n found on ddte osk atops or servers. While our proposed reduction steps affect the overall mean Average Precision (mAP), they are able to maintain a good Precision for the top K results (PK). We argue that for such offline application, maintaining a good PK is sufficient. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on several standard databases. A working application designed for a remote historical site is also presented. This application is able to reduce an 50,000 image index structure to 25 MBs while providing a precision of 97% for P10 and 100% for P1.</p><p>6 0.25297797 <a title="210-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Grids%3A_Fast_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_and_Range_Searching_for_Image_Search.html">337 iccv-2013-Random Grids: Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors and Range Searching for Image Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Cai-Zhi Zhu, Hervé Jégou, Shin'Ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Visual object retrieval aims at retrieving, from a collection of images, all those in which a given query object appears. It is inherently asymmetric: the query object is mostly included in the database image, while the converse is not necessarily true. However, existing approaches mostly compare the images with symmetrical measures, without considering the different roles of query and database. This paper first measure the extent of asymmetry on large-scale public datasets reflecting this task. Considering the standard bag-of-words representation, we then propose new asymmetrical dissimilarities accounting for the different inlier ratios associated with query and database images. These asymmetrical measures depend on the query, yet they are compatible with an inverted file structure, without noticeably impacting search efficiency. Our experiments show the benefit of our approach, and show that the visual object retrieval task is better treated asymmetrically, in the spirit of state-of-the-art text retrieval.</p><p>4 0.74458748 <a title="210-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Offline_Mobile_Instance_Retrieval_with_a_Small_Memory_Footprint.html">294 iccv-2013-Offline Mobile Instance Retrieval with a Small Memory Footprint</a></p>

<p>Author: Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes modeling the complex web image collections with an automatically generated graph structure called visual semantic complex network (VSCN). The nodes on this complex network are clusters of images with both visual and semantic consistency, called semantic concepts. These nodes are connected based on the visual and semantic correlations. Our VSCN with 33, 240 concepts is generated from a collection of 10 million web images. 1 A great deal of valuable information on the structures of the web image collections can be revealed by exploring the VSCN, such as the small-world behavior, concept community, indegree distribution, hubs, and isolated concepts. It not only helps us better understand the web image collections at a macroscopic level, but also has many important practical applications. This paper presents two application examples: content-based image retrieval and image browsing. Experimental results show that the VSCN leads to significant improvement on both the precision of image retrieval (over 200%) and user experience for image browsing.</p><p>6 0.7329663 <a title="210-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Subspace_Search_via_Grassmannian_Based_Hashing.html">162 iccv-2013-Fast Subspace Search via Grassmannian Based Hashing</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudia Nieuwenhuis, Evgeny Strekalovskiy, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a convex multilabel framework for image sequence segmentation which allows to impose proportion priors on object parts in order to preserve their size ratios across multiple images. The key idea is that for strongly deformable objects such as a gymnast the size ratio of respective regions (head versus torso, legs versus full body, etc.) is typically preserved. We propose different ways to impose such priors in a Bayesian framework for image segmentation. We show that near-optimal solutions can be computed using convex relaxation techniques. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proportion priors allow for highly accurate segmentations, avoiding seeping-out of regions and preserving semantically relevant small-scale structures such as hands or feet. They naturally apply to multiple object instances such as players in sports scenes, and they can relate different objects instead of object parts, e.g. organs in medical imaging. The algorithm is efficient and easily parallelized leading to proportion-consistent segmentations at runtimes around one second.</p><p>2 0.85121071 <a title="210-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Cross-Field_Joint_Image_Restoration_via_Scale_Map.html">98 iccv-2013-Cross-Field Joint Image Restoration via Scale Map</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Xiaoyong Shen, Li Xu, Shaojie Zhuo, Xiaopeng Zhang, Liang Shen, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: Color, infrared, and flash images captured in different fields can be employed to effectively eliminate noise and other visual artifacts. We propose a two-image restoration framework considering input images in different fields, for example, one noisy color image and one dark-flashed nearinfrared image. The major issue in such a framework is to handle structure divergence and find commonly usable edges and smooth transition for visually compelling image reconstruction. We introduce a scale map as a competent representation to explicitly model derivative-level confidence and propose new functions and a numerical solver to effectively infer it following new structural observations. Our method is general and shows a principled way for cross-field restoration.</p><p>3 0.84306288 <a title="210-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Scene_Text_Localization_and_Recognition_with_Oriented_Stroke_Detection.html">376 iccv-2013-Scene Text Localization and Recognition with Oriented Stroke Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukáš Neumann, Jiri Matas</p><p>Abstract: An unconstrained end-to-end text localization and recognition method is presented. The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearestneighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition.</p><p>4 0.83793175 <a title="210-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware_Co-indexing_for_Image_Retrieval.html">378 iccv-2013-Semantic-Aware Co-indexing for Image Retrieval</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiliang Zhang, Ming Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Yuanqing Lin, Qi Tian</p><p>Abstract: Inverted indexes in image retrieval not only allow fast access to database images but also summarize all knowledge about the database, so that their discriminative capacity largely determines the retrieval performance. In this paper, for vocabulary tree based image retrieval, we propose a semantic-aware co-indexing algorithm to jointly San Antonio, TX 78249 . j dl@gmai l com qit ian@cs .ut sa . edu . The query embed two strong cues into the inverted indexes: 1) local invariant features that are robust to delineate low-level image contents, and 2) semantic attributes from large-scale object recognition that may reveal image semantic meanings. For an initial set of inverted indexes of local features, we utilize 1000 semantic attributes to filter out isolated images and insert semantically similar images to the initial set. Encoding these two distinct cues together effectively enhances the discriminative capability of inverted indexes. Such co-indexing operations are totally off-line and introduce small computation overhead to online query cause only local features but no semantic attributes are used for query. Experiments and comparisons with recent retrieval methods on 3 datasets, i.e., UKbench, Holidays, Oxford5K, and 1.3 million images from Flickr as distractors, manifest the competitive performance of our method 1.</p><p>5 0.8371771 <a title="210-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Class-Specific_Simplex-Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_for_Image_Classification.html">73 iccv-2013-Class-Specific Simplex-Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mandar Dixit, Nikhil Rasiwasia, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: An extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), denoted class-specific-simplex LDA (css-LDA), is proposed for image classification. An analysis of the supervised LDA models currently used for this task shows that the impact of class information on the topics discovered by these models is very weak in general. This implies that the discovered topics are driven by general image regularities, rather than the semantic regularities of interest for classification. To address this, we introduce a model that induces supervision in topic discovery, while retaining the original flexibility of LDA to account for unanticipated structures of interest. The proposed css-LDA is an LDA model with class supervision at the level of image features. In css-LDA topics are discovered per class, i.e. a single set of topics shared across classes is replaced by multiple class-specific topic sets. This model can be used for generative classification using the Bayes decision rule or even extended to discriminative classification with support vector machines (SVMs). A css-LDA model can endow an image with a vector of class and topic specific count statistics that are similar to the Bag-of-words (BoW) histogram. SVM-based discriminants can be learned for classes in the space of these histograms. The effectiveness of css-LDA model in both generative and discriminative classification frameworks is demonstrated through an extensive experimental evaluation, involving multiple benchmark datasets, where it is shown to outperform all existing LDA based image classification approaches.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.8284936 <a title="210-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Image_Retrieval_Using_Textual_Cues.html">210 iccv-2013-Image Retrieval Using Textual Cues</a></p>
