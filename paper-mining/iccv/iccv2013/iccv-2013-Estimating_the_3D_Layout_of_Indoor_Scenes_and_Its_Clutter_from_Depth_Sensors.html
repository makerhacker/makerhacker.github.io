<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generative model to describe the layouts of outdoor scenes the spatial configuration of regions. Specifically, the layout of an image is represented as a composite of regions, each associated with a semantic topic. At the heart of this model is a novel stochastic process called Spatial Topic Process, which generates a spatial map of topics from a set of coupled Gaussian processes, thus allowing the distributions of topics to vary continuously across the image plane. A key aspect that distinguishes this model from previous ones consists in its capability of capturing dependencies across both locations and topics while allowing substantial variations in the layouts. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed model by testing it on scene classification, semantic segmentation, and layout hallucination. –</p><p>4 0.31340954 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-3DNN%3A_Viewpoint_Invariant_3D_Geometry_Matching_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 iccv-2013-3DNN: Viewpoint Invariant 3D Geometry Matching for Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Satkin, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm 3DNN (3D NearestNeighbor), which is capable of matching an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint from which the image was captured. By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.</p><p>5 0.2503548 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Video_SEEDS_for_Temporal_Window_Objectness.html">299 iccv-2013-Online Video SEEDS for Temporal Window Objectness</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Van_Den_Bergh, Gemma Roig, Xavier Boix, Santiago Manen, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Superpixel and objectness algorithms are broadly used as a pre-processing step to generate support regions and to speed-up further computations. Recently, many algorithms have been extended to video in order to exploit the temporal consistency between frames. However, most methods are computationally too expensive for real-time applications. We introduce an online, real-time video superpixel algorithm based on the recently proposed SEEDS superpixels. A new capability is incorporated which delivers multiple diverse samples (hypotheses) of superpixels in the same image or video sequence. The multiple samples are shown to provide a strong cue to efficiently measure the objectness of image windows, and we introduce the novel concept of objectness in temporal windows. Experiments show that the video superpixels achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art offline methods while running at 30 fps on a single 2.8 GHz i7 CPU. State-of-the-art performance on objectness is also demonstrated, yet orders of magnitude faster and extended to temporal windows in video.</p><p>6 0.23588116 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Object_Segmentation_in_Space_and_Time.html">282 iccv-2013-Multi-view Object Segmentation in Space and Time</a></p>

<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of indoor scene understanding using RGBD data. Towards this goal, we propose a holistic approach that exploits 2D segmentation, 3D geometry, as well as contextual relations between scenes and objects. Specifically, we extend the CPMC [3] framework to 3D in order to generate candidate cuboids, and develop a conditional random field to integrate information from different sources to classify the cuboids. With this formulation, scene classification and 3D object recognition are coupled and can be jointly solved through probabilistic inference. We test the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU v2 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that through effective evidence integration and holistic reasoning, our approach achieves substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.49202976 <a title="144-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Efficient_3D_Scene_Labeling_Using_Fields_of_Trees.html">132 iccv-2013-Efficient 3D Scene Labeling Using Fields of Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Yong Jae Lee, Alexei A. Efros, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a weakly-supervised visual data mining approach that discovers connections between recurring midlevel visual elements in historic (temporal) and geographic (spatial) image collections, and attempts to capture the underlying visual style. In contrast to existing discovery methods that mine for patterns that remain visually consistent throughout the dataset, our goal is to discover visual elements whose appearance changes due to change in time or location; i.e., exhibit consistent stylistic variations across the label space (date or geo-location). To discover these elements, we first identify groups of patches that are stylesensitive. We then incrementally build correspondences to find the same element across the entire dataset. Finally, we train style-aware regressors that model each element’s range of stylistic differences. We apply our approach to date and geo-location prediction and show substantial improvement over several baselines that do not model visual style. We also demonstrate the method’s effectiveness on the related task of fine-grained classification.</p><p>3 0.90088648 <a title="144-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Sequential_Bayesian_Model_Update_under_Structured_Scene_Prior_for_Semantic_Road_Scenes_Labeling.html">386 iccv-2013-Sequential Bayesian Model Update under Structured Scene Prior for Semantic Road Scenes Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Evgeny Levinkov, Mario Fritz</p><p>Abstract: Semantic road labeling is a key component of systems that aim at assisted or even autonomous driving. Considering that such systems continuously operate in the realworld, unforeseen conditions not represented in any conceivable training procedure are likely to occur on a regular basis. In order to equip systems with the ability to cope with such situations, we would like to enable adaptation to such new situations and conditions at runtime. Existing adaptive methods for image labeling either require labeled data from the new condition or even operate globally on a complete test set. None of this is a desirable mode of operation for a system as described above where new images arrive sequentially and conditions may vary. We study the effect of changing test conditions on scene labeling methods based on a new diverse street scene dataset. We propose a novel approach that can operate in such conditions and is based on a sequential Bayesian model update in order to robustly integrate the arriving images into the adapting procedure.</p><p>4 0.89892709 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Slice_Sampling_Particle_Belief_Propagation.html">395 iccv-2013-Slice Sampling Particle Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Müller, Michael Ying Yang, Bodo Rosenhahn</p><p>Abstract: Inference in continuous label Markov random fields is a challenging task. We use particle belief propagation (PBP) for solving the inference problem in continuous label space. Sampling particles from the belief distribution is typically done by using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods which involves sampling from a proposal distribution. This proposal distribution has to be carefully designed depending on the particular model and input data to achieve fast convergence. We propose to avoid dependence on a proposal distribution by introducing a slice sampling based PBP algorithm. The proposed approach shows superior convergence performance on an image denoising toy example. Our findings are validated on a challenging relational 2D feature tracking application.</p><p>5 0.8976509 <a title="144-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>
<p>Author: K.C. Amit Kumar, Christophe De_Vleeschouwer</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of plausible detections, detected at each time instant independently, we investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating labels on a set of graphs that capture how the spatio-temporal and the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels to a pair of nodes. The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs. This results into a difference of convex program that can be efficiently solved. Experiments are performed on a basketball and several well-known pedestrian datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><p>6 0.89648402 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Recognition_in_Photo_Collections_with_a_Stopwatch_HMM.html">147 iccv-2013-Event Recognition in Photo Collections with a Stopwatch HMM</a></p>
