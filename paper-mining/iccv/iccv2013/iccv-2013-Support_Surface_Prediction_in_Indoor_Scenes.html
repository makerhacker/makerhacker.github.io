<p>Author: Byung-Soo Kim, Pushmeet Kohli, Silvio Savarese</p><p>Abstract: Scene understanding is an important yet very challenging problem in computer vision. In the past few years, researchers have taken advantage of the recent diffusion of depth-RGB (RGB-D) cameras to help simplify the problem of inferring scene semantics. However, while the added 3D geometry is certainly useful to segment out objects with different depth values, it also adds complications in that the 3D geometry is often incorrect because of noisy depth measurements and the actual 3D extent of the objects is usually unknown because of occlusions. In this paper we propose a new method that allows us to jointly refine the 3D reconstruction of the scene (raw depth values) while accurately segmenting out the objects or scene elements from the 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by introducing a new model which we called Voxel-CRF. The Voxel-CRF model is based on the idea of constructing a conditional random field over a 3D volume of interest which captures the semantic and 3D geometric relationships among different elements (voxels) of the scene. Such model allows to jointly estimate (1) a dense voxel-based 3D reconstruction and (2) the semantic labels associated with each voxel even in presence of par- tial occlusions using an approximate yet efficient inference strategy. We evaluated our method on the challenging NYU Depth dataset (Version 1and 2). Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive accuracy in inferring scene semantics and visually appealing results in improving the quality of the 3D reconstruction. We also demonstrate an interesting application of object removal and scene completion from RGB-D images.</p><p>3 0.24548486 <a title="410-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Weinmann, Aljosa Osep, Roland Ruiters, Reinhard Klein</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel, robust multi-view normal field integration technique for reconstructing the full 3D shape of mirroring objects. We employ a turntablebased setup with several cameras and displays. These are used to display illumination patterns which are reflected by the object surface. The pattern information observed in the cameras enables the calculation of individual volumetric normal fields for each combination of camera, display and turntable angle. As the pattern information might be blurred depending on the surface curvature or due to nonperfect mirroring surface characteristics, we locally adapt the decoding to the finest still resolvable pattern resolution. In complex real-world scenarios, the normal fields contain regions without observations due to occlusions and outliers due to interreflections and noise. Therefore, a robust reconstruction using only normal information is challenging. Via a non-parametric clustering of normal hypotheses derived for each point in the scene, we obtain both the most likely local surface normal and a local surface consistency estimate. This information is utilized in an iterative mincut based variational approach to reconstruct the surface geometry.</p><p>4 0.24317591 <a title="410-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Large-Scale_Multi-resolution_Surface_Reconstruction_from_RGB-D_Sequences.html">228 iccv-2013-Large-Scale Multi-resolution Surface Reconstruction from RGB-D Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Steinbrücker, Christian Kerl, Daniel Cremers</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method to generate highly detailed, textured 3D models of large environments from RGB-D sequences. Our system runs in real-time on a standard desktop PC with a state-of-the-art graphics card. To reduce the memory consumption, we fuse the acquired depth maps and colors in a multi-scale octree representation of a signed distance function. To estimate the camera poses, we construct a pose graph and use dense image alignment to determine the relative pose between pairs of frames. We add edges between nodes when we detect loop-closures and optimize the pose graph to correct for long-term drift. Our implementation is highly parallelized on graphics hardware to achieve real-time performance. More specifically, we can reconstruct, store, and continuously update a colored 3D model of an entire corridor of nine rooms at high levels of detail in real-time on a single GPU with 2.5GB.</p><p>5 0.24101956 <a title="410-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-3DNN%3A_Viewpoint_Invariant_3D_Geometry_Matching_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 iccv-2013-3DNN: Viewpoint Invariant 3D Geometry Matching for Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Satkin, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm 3DNN (3D NearestNeighbor), which is capable of matching an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint from which the image was captured. By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.</p><p>6 0.2093742 <a title="410-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Real-World_Normal_Map_Capture_for_Nearly_Flat_Reflective_Surfaces.html">343 iccv-2013-Real-World Normal Map Capture for Nearly Flat Reflective Surfaces</a></p>

We argue that these primitives should be both visually discriminative and geometrically informative and we present a technique for discovering such primitives. We demonstrate the utility of our primitives by using them to infer 3D surface normals given a single image. Our technique substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art and shows improved cross-dataset performance.</p><p>4 0.69061071 <a title="410-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Point-Based_3D_Reconstruction_of_Thin_Objects.html">319 iccv-2013-Point-Based 3D Reconstruction of Thin Objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Ummenhofer, Thomas Brox</p><p>Abstract: 3D reconstruction deals with the problem of finding the shape of an object from a set of images. Thin objects that have virtually no volumepose a special challengefor reconstruction with respect to shape representation and fusion of depth information. In this paper we present a dense pointbased reconstruction method that can deal with this special class of objects. We seek to jointly optimize a set of depth maps by treating each pixel as a point in space. Points are pulled towards a common surface by pairwise forces in an iterative scheme. The method also handles the problem of opposed surfaces by means of penalty forces. Efficient optimization is achieved by grouping points to superpixels and a spatial hashing approach for fast neighborhood queries. We show that the approach is on a par with state-of-the-art methods for standard multi view stereo settings and gives superior results for thin objects.</p><p>5 0.68277878 <a title="410-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Normal_Field_Integration_for_3D_Reconstruction_of_Mirroring_Objects.html">281 iccv-2013-Multi-view Normal Field Integration for 3D Reconstruction of Mirroring Objects</a></p>

<p>Author: Taehwan Kim, Greg Shakhnarovich, Karen Livescu</p><p>Abstract: Recognition of gesture sequences is in general a very difficult problem, but in certain domains the difficulty may be mitigated by exploiting the domain ’s “grammar”. One such grammatically constrained gesture sequence domain is sign language. In this paper we investigate the case of fingerspelling recognition, which can be very challenging due to the quick, small motions of the fingers. Most prior work on this task has assumed a closed vocabulary of fingerspelled words; here we study the more natural open-vocabulary case, where the only domain knowledge is the possible fingerspelled letters and statistics of their sequences. We develop a semi-Markov conditional model approach, where feature functions are defined over segments of video and their corresponding letter labels. We use classifiers of letters and linguistic handshape features, along with expected motion profiles, to define segmental feature functions. This approach improves letter error rate (Levenshtein distance between hypothesized and correct letter sequences) from 16.3% using a hidden Markov model baseline to 11.6% us- ing the proposed semi-Markov model.</p><p>2 0.93981087 <a title="410-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Dominance%3A_What_Pops_Out%3F.html">53 iccv-2013-Attribute Dominance: What Pops Out?</a></p>
<p>Author: Naman Turakhia, Devi Parikh</p><p>Abstract: When we look at an image, some properties or attributes of the image stand out more than others. When describing an image, people are likely to describe these dominant attributes first. Attribute dominance is a result of a complex interplay between the various properties present or absent in the image. Which attributes in an image are more dominant than others reveals rich information about the content of the image. In this paper we tap into this information by modeling attribute dominance. We show that this helps improve the performance of vision systems on a variety of human-centric applications such as zero-shot learning, image search and generating textual descriptions of images.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.93232721 <a title="410-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Support_Surface_Prediction_in_Indoor_Scenes.html">410 iccv-2013-Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruiqi Guo, Derek Hoiem</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach to predict the extent and height of supporting surfaces such as tables, chairs, and cabinet tops from a single RGBD image. We define support surfaces to be horizontal, planar surfaces that can physically support objects and humans. Given a RGBD image, our goal is to localize the height and full extent of such surfaces in 3D space. To achieve this, we created a labeling tool and annotated 1449 images with rich, complete 3D scene models in NYU dataset. We extract ground truth from the annotated dataset and developed a pipeline for predicting floor space, walls, the height and full extent of support surfaces. Finally we match the predicted extent with annotated scenes in training scenes and transfer the the support surface configuration from training scenes. We evaluate the proposed approach in our dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in understanding scenes in 3D space.</p><p>4 0.93147033 <a title="410-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Hierarchical_Data-Driven_Descent_for_Efficient_Optimal_Deformation_Estimation.html">196 iccv-2013-Hierarchical Data-Driven Descent for Efficient Optimal Deformation Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuandong Tian, Srinivasa G. Narasimhan</p><p>Abstract: Real-world surfaces such as clothing, water and human body deform in complex ways. The image distortions observed are high-dimensional and non-linear, making it hard to estimate these deformations accurately. The recent datadriven descent approach [17] applies Nearest Neighbor estimators iteratively on a particular distribution of training samples to obtain a globally optimal and dense deformation field between a template and a distorted image. In this work, we develop a hierarchical structure for the Nearest Neighbor estimators, each of which can have only a local image support. We demonstrate in both theory and practice that this algorithm has several advantages over the nonhierarchical version: it guarantees global optimality with significantly fewer training samples, is several orders faster, provides a metric to decide whether a given image is “hard” (or “easy ”) requiring more (or less) samples, and can handle more complex scenes that include both global motion and local deformation. The proposed algorithm successfully tracks a broad range of non-rigid scenes including water, clothing, and medical images, and compares favorably against several other deformation estimation and tracking approaches that do not provide optimality guarantees.</p><p>5 0.92928958 <a title="410-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Pivots_for_Guiding_Relevance_Feedback_in_Image_Search.html">54 iccv-2013-Attribute Pivots for Guiding Relevance Feedback in Image Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Adriana Kovashka, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: In interactive image search, a user iteratively refines his results by giving feedback on exemplar images. Active selection methods aim to elicit useful feedback, but traditional approaches suffer from expensive selection criteria and cannot predict informativeness reliably due to the imprecision of relevance feedback. To address these drawbacks, we propose to actively select “pivot” exemplars for which feedback in the form of a visual comparison will most reduce the system’s uncertainty. For example, the system might ask, “Is your target image more or less crowded than this image? ” Our approach relies on a series of binary search trees in relative attribute space, together with a selection function that predicts the information gain were the user to compare his envisioned target to the next node deeper in a given attribute ’s tree. It makes interactive search more efficient than existing strategies—both in terms of the system ’s selection time as well as the user’s feedback effort.</p><p>6 0.92869955 <a title="410-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Attribute_Adaptation_for_Personalized_Image_Search.html">52 iccv-2013-Attribute Adaptation for Personalized Image Search</a></p>
