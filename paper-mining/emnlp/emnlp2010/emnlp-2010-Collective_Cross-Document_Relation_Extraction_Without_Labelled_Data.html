<p>Author: Karthik Raghunathan ; Heeyoung Lee ; Sudarshan Rangarajan ; Nate Chambers ; Mihai Surdeanu ; Dan Jurafsky ; Christopher Manning</p><p>Abstract: Most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier’s entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sievebased approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks.</p><p>3 0.068465233 <a title="28-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Improving_Mention_Detection_Robustness_to_Noisy_Input.html">62 emnlp-2010-Improving Mention Detection Robustness to Noisy Input</a></p>
<p>Author: Radu Florian ; John Pitrelli ; Salim Roukos ; Imed Zitouni</p><p>Abstract: Information-extraction (IE) research typically focuses on clean-text inputs. However, an IE engine serving real applications yields many false alarms due to less-well-formed input. For example, IE in a multilingual broadcast processing system has to deal with inaccurate automatic transcription and translation. The resulting presence of non-target-language text in this case, and non-language material interspersed in data from other applications, raise the research problem of making IE robust to such noisy input text. We address one such IE task: entity-mention detection. We describe augmenting a statistical mention-detection system in order to reduce false alarms from spurious passages. The diverse nature of input noise leads us to pursue a multi-faceted approach to robustness. For our English-language system, at various miss rates we eliminate 97% of false alarms on inputs from other Latin-alphabet languages. In another experiment, representing scenarios in which genre-specific training is infeasible, we process real financial-transactions text containing mixed languages and data-set codes. On these data, because we do not train on data like it, we achieve a smaller but significant improvement. These gains come with virtually no loss in accuracy on clean English text.</p><p>4 0.065045767 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Detection_and_Classification_of_Social_Events.html">20 emnlp-2010-Automatic Detection and Classification of Social Events</a></p>
<p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal ; Owen Rambow</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce the new task of social event extraction from text. We distinguish two broad types of social events depending on whether only one or both parties are aware of the social contact. We annotate part of Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) data, and perform experiments using Support Vector Machines with Kernel methods. We use a combination of structures derived from phrase structure trees and dependency trees. A characteristic of our events (which distinguishes them from ACE events) is that the participating entities can be spread far across the parse trees. We use syntactic and semantic insights to devise a new structure derived from dependency trees and show that this plays a role in achieving the best performing system for both social event detection and classification tasks. We also use three data sampling approaches to solve the problem of data skewness. Sampling methods improve the F1-measure for the task of relation detection by over 20% absolute over the baseline.</p><p>5 0.063231118 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Mining_Name_Translations_from_Entity_Graph_Mapping.html">79 emnlp-2010-Mining Name Translations from Entity Graph Mapping</a></p>
<p>Author: Gae-won You ; Seung-won Hwang ; Young-In Song ; Long Jiang ; Zaiqing Nie</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mining entity translation, specifically, mining English and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliterationbased approach leveraging phonetic similarity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploiting bilingual co-occurrences, each of which suffers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. In clear contrast, we use unleveraged resources of monolingual entity co-occurrences, crawled from entity search engines, represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach, of exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach, building upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work, requiring scarce resources of parallel or compa- rable corpus, while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. We validate our proposed system using real-life datasets.</p><p>6 0.054810666 <a title="28-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Incorporating_Content_Structure_into_Text_Analysis_Applications.html">64 emnlp-2010-Incorporating Content Structure into Text Analysis Applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Lin ; Mausam ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Determining whether a textual phrase denotes a functional relation (i.e., a relation that maps each domain element to a unique range element) is useful for numerous NLP tasks such as synonym resolution and contradiction detection. Previous work on this problem has relied on either counting methods or lexico-syntactic patterns. However, determining whether a relation is functional, by analyzing mentions of the relation in a corpus, is challenging due to ambiguity, synonymy, anaphora, and other linguistic phenomena. We present the LEIBNIZ system that overcomes these challenges by exploiting the synergy between the Web corpus and freelyavailable knowledge resources such as Freebase. It first computes multiple typedfunctionality scores, representing functionality of the relation phrase when its arguments are constrained to specific types. It then aggregates these scores to predict the global functionality for the phrase. LEIBNIZ outperforms previous work, increasing area under the precisionrecall curve from 0.61 to 0.88. We utilize LEIBNIZ to generate the first public repository of automatically-identified functional relations.</p><p>5 0.30940717 <a title="28-lsi-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Automatic_Detection_and_Classification_of_Social_Events.html">20 emnlp-2010-Automatic Detection and Classification of Social Events</a></p>

<p>Author: Qiaoming Zhu ; Junhui Li ; Hongling Wang ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: This paper approaches the scope learning problem via simplified shallow semantic parsing. This is done by regarding the cue as the predicate and mapping its scope into several constituents as the arguments of the cue. Evaluation on the BioScope corpus shows that the structural information plays a critical role in capturing the relationship between a cue and its dominated arguments. It also shows that our parsing approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art chunking ones. Although our parsing approach is only evaluated on negation and speculation scope learning here, it is portable to other kinds of scope learning. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87762618 <a title="28-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2010-Collective_Cross-Document_Relation_Extraction_Without_Labelled_Data.html">28 emnlp-2010-Collective Cross-Document Relation Extraction Without Labelled Data</a></p>

For the out-of-domain data, we benefit strongly from joint modelling, and observe improvements in precision of 13% over the pipeline, and 15% over the isolated baseline.</p><p>3 0.78729612 <a title="28-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Uptraining_for_Accurate_Deterministic_Question_Parsing.html">115 emnlp-2010-Uptraining for Accurate Deterministic Question Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Slav Petrov ; Pi-Chuan Chang ; Michael Ringgaard ; Hiyan Alshawi</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that parsing accuracies drop significantly on out-of-domain data. What is less known is that some parsers suffer more from domain shifts than others. We show that dependency parsers have more difficulty parsing questions than constituency parsers. In particular, deterministic shift-reduce dependency parsers, which are of highest interest for practical applications because of their linear running time, drop to 60% labeled accuracy on a question test set. We propose an uptraining procedure in which a deterministic parser is trained on the output of a more accurate, but slower, latent variable constituency parser (converted to dependencies). Uptraining with 100K unlabeled questions achieves results comparable to having 2K labeled questions for training. With 100K unlabeled and 2K labeled questions, uptraining is able to improve parsing accuracy to 84%, closing the gap between in-domain and out-of-domain performance.</p><p>4 0.69677311 <a title="28-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-What_a_Parser_Can_Learn_from_a_Semantic_Role_Labeler_and_Vice_Versa.html">121 emnlp-2010-What a Parser Can Learn from a Semantic Role Labeler and Vice Versa</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Boxwell ; Dennis Mehay ; Chris Brew</p><p>Abstract: In many NLP systems, there is a unidirectional flow of information in which a parser supplies input to a semantic role labeler. In this paper, we build a system that allows information to flow in both directions. We make use of semantic role predictions in choosing a single-best parse. This process relies on an averaged perceptron model to distinguish likely semantic roles from erroneous ones. Our system penalizes parses that give rise to low-scoring semantic roles. To explore the consequences of this we perform two experiments. First, we use a baseline generative model to produce n-best parses, which are then re-ordered by our semantic model. Second, we use a modified version of our semantic role labeler to predict semantic roles at parse time. The performance of this modified labeler is weaker than that of our best full SRL, because it is restricted to features that can be computed directly from the parser’s packed chart. For both experiments, the resulting semantic predictions are then used to select parses. Finally, we feed the selected parses produced by each experiment to the full version of our semantic role labeler. We find that SRL performance can be improved over this baseline by selecting parses with likely semantic roles.</p><p>5 0.51749206 <a title="28-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Function-Based_Question_Classification_for_General_QA.html">51 emnlp-2010-Function-Based Question Classification for General QA</a></p>
<p>Author: Fan Bu ; Xingwei Zhu ; Yu Hao ; Xiaoyan Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In contrast with the booming increase of internet data, state-of-art QA (question answering) systems, otherwise, concerned data from specific domains or resources such as search engine snippets, online forums and Wikipedia in a somewhat isolated way. Users may welcome a more general QA system for its capability to answer questions of various sources, integrated from existed specialized sub-QA engines. In this framework, question classification is the primary task. However, the current paradigms of question classification were focused on some specified type of questions, i.e. factoid questions, which are inappropriate for the general QA. In this paper, we propose a new question classification paradigm, which includes a question taxonomy suitable to the general QA and a question classifier based on MLN (Markov logic network), where rule-based methods and statistical methods are unified into a single framework in a fuzzy discriminative learning approach. Experiments show that our method outperforms traditional question classification approaches.</p><p>6 0.47033459 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-A_Tree_Kernel-Based_Unified_Framework_for_Chinese_Zero_Anaphora_Resolution.html">14 emnlp-2010-A Tree Kernel-Based Unified Framework for Chinese Zero Anaphora Resolution</a></p>
