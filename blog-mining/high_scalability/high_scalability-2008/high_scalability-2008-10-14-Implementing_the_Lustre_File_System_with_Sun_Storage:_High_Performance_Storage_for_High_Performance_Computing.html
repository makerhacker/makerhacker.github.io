<p>Introduction: When designing data storage solutions for High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments, IT architects strive to balance complex and often conflicting
requirements. The need to manage a skyrocketing amount of data, along with the
goals of controlling cost and immediate data availability, can make it
difficult to meet HPC application demands within the constraints of today's IT
budgets. To help customers address an almost bewildering set of architectural
challenges, Sun has developed the Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC, a
reference architecture that can be easily customized to meet specific
application goals and business requirements.This article is intended for IT
managers and storage architects familiar with HPC applications and data
requirements in the organization. It assumes that the audience has a technical
background and some familiarity with issues surrounding the task of
configuring systems and storage.</p><p>3 0.30354777 <a title="411-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lustre速is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are

<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services. The co</p><p>6 0.19833043 <a title="411-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-17-Sun_to_Announce_Open_Cloud_APIs_at_CommunityOne.html">543 high scalability-2009-03-17-Sun to Announce Open Cloud APIs at CommunityOne</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This Sun BluePrint article describes the storage architecture of the Tokyo
Institute of Technology TSUBAME grid. The Tokyo Institute of Technology is of
the world's leading technical institutes, and recently created the fastest
supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest supercomputers outside of the
United States. By deploying Sun Fire x64 servers and data servers in a grid
architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective and flexible supercomputer
consisting of hundreds of systems, thousands of processors, terabytes of
memory and a petabyte of storage that supports users running common off-the-

<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer)
wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the
wider technology community.What is an In Memory Data Grid?It is not an in-
memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is
a different breed of software datastore.In summary an IMDG is an 'off the
shelf' software product that exhibits the following characteristics:The data
model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across
multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This
distributed model is known as a 'shared nothing' architecture.All servers can
be active in each site.All data is stored in the RAM of the servers.Servers
can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM
available.The data model is non-relational and is object-based. Distributed
applications written on the .NET and Java application platforms are
supported.The data fabric is re</p><p>3 0.91992021 <a title="411-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-05-SLA_monitoring.html">241 high scalability-2008-02-05-SLA monitoring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700
customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our
customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes,
response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of
customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual
SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the
application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for
our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now
approaching about 30-40 GB a day.What we really need is monitoring software
that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us
see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate
data in different ways. Would the best approach be to develop a custom
solution (for instance a distributed app that aggregates data from different
logs every night a</p><p>4 0.91353607 <a title="411-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public_Cloud.html">444 high scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our
applicati</p><p>5 0.90586907 <a title="411-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_GridLayer._Utility_computing_for_online_application.html">42 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: GridLayer. Utility computing for online application</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TGLdelivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids
of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected
with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating
system.With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own
private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable
virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers,
database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can
build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as
templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own
virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>6 0.90283483 <a title="411-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop_Scales_to_1_Million_Active_Users_on_GAE%2C_Showing_PaaS_is_not_Pass%C3%A9.html">1412 high scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop Scales to 1 Million Active Users on GAE, Showing PaaS is not Passé</a></p>
