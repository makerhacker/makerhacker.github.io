<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon ; Phil Bartie ; Tiphaine Dalmas ; Anna Dickinson ; Xingkun Liu ; William Mackaness ; Bonnie Webber</p><p>Abstract: We present a city navigation and tourist information mobile dialogue app with integrated question-answering (QA) and geographic information system (GIS) modules that helps pedestrian users to navigate in and learn about urban environments. In contrast to existing mobile apps which treat these problems independently, our Android app addresses the problem of navigation and touristic questionanswering in an integrated fashion using a shared dialogue context. We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. They also rated our system above Google search (with the Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist information tasks.</p><p>3 0.067659669 <a title="268-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-HYENA-live%3A_Fine-Grained_Online_Entity_Type_Classification_from_Natural-language_Text.html">179 acl-2013-HYENA-live: Fine-Grained Online Entity Type Classification from Natural-language Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Sandro Bauer ; Johannes Hoffart ; Marc Spaniol ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has shown progress in achieving high-quality, very fine-grained type classification in hierarchical taxonomies. Within such a multi-level type hierarchy with several hundreds of types at different levels, many entities naturally belong to multiple types. In order to achieve high-precision in type classification, current approaches are either limited to certain domains or require time consuming multistage computations. As a consequence, existing systems are incapable of performing ad-hoc type classification on arbitrary input texts. In this demo, we present a novel Webbased tool that is able to perform domain independent entity type classification under real time conditions. Thanks to its efficient implementation and compacted feature representation, the system is able to process text inputs on-the-fly while still achieving equally high precision as leading state-ofthe-art implementations. Our system offers an online interface where natural-language text can be inserted, which returns semantic type labels for entity mentions. Further more, the user interface allows users to explore the assigned types by visualizing and navigating along the type-hierarchy.</p><p>4 0.066849522 <a title="268-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Improving_pairwise_coreference_models_through_feature_space_hierarchy_learning.html">196 acl-2013-Improving pairwise coreference models through feature space hierarchy learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Emmanuel Lassalle ; Pascal Denis</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for significantly improving the performance of pairwise coreference models. Given a set of indicators, our method learns how to best separate types of mention pairs into equivalence classes for which we construct distinct classification models. In effect, our approach finds an optimal feature space (derived from a base feature set and indicator set) for discriminating coreferential mention pairs. Although our approach explores a very large space of possible feature spaces, it remains tractable by exploiting the structure of the hierarchies built from the indicators. Our exper- iments on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English datasets (gold mentions) indicate that our method is robust relative to different clustering strategies and evaluation metrics, showing large and consistent improvements over a single pairwise model using the same base features. Our best system obtains a competitive 67.2 of average F1 over MUC, and CEAF which, despite its simplicity, places it above the mean score of other systems on these datasets.

<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANET’s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>6 0.036258291 <a title="268-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-SPred%3A_Large-scale_Harvesting_of_Semantic_Predicates.html">306 acl-2013-SPred: Large-scale Harvesting of Semantic Predicates</a></p>

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>3 0.60533381 <a title="268-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-IndoNet%3A_A_Multilingual_Lexical_Knowledge_Network_for_Indian_Languages.html">198 acl-2013-IndoNet: A Multilingual Lexical Knowledge Network for Indian Languages</a></p>

It is a linked structure of wordnets of 18 different Indian languages, Universal Word dictionary and the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). We discuss various benefits of the network and challenges involved in the development. The system is encoded in Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) and we propose modifications in LMF to accommodate Universal Word Dictionary and SUMO. This standardized version of lexical knowledge base of Indian Languages can now easily , be linked to similar global resources.</p><p>4 0.60050082 <a title="268-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-AnnoMarket%3A_An_Open_Cloud_Platform_for_NLP.html">51 acl-2013-AnnoMarket: An Open Cloud Platform for NLP</a></p>
<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>5 0.59158301 <a title="268-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Extending_an_interoperable_platform_to_facilitate_the_creation_of_multilingual_and_multimodal_NLP_applications.html">150 acl-2013-Extending an interoperable platform to facilitate the creation of multilingual and multimodal NLP applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Phillippe Langlais</p><p>Abstract: Analogical learning over strings is a holistic model that has been investigated by a few authors as a means to map forms of a source language to forms of a target language. In this study, we revisit this learning paradigm and apply it to the transliteration task. We show that alone, it performs worse than a statistical phrase-based machine translation engine, but the combination of both approaches outperforms each one taken separately, demonstrating the usefulness of the information captured by a so-called formal analogy.</p><p>3 0.57945395 <a title="268-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Improved_Lexical_Acquisition_through_DPP-based_Verb_Clustering.html">192 acl-2013-Improved Lexical Acquisition through DPP-based Verb Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Subcategorization frames (SCFs), selectional preferences (SPs) and verb classes capture related aspects of the predicateargument structure. We present the first unified framework for unsupervised learning of these three types of information. We show how to utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), elegant probabilistic models that are defined over the possible subsets of a given dataset and give higher probability mass to high quality and diverse subsets, for clustering. Our novel clustering algorithm constructs a joint SCF-DPP DPP kernel matrix and utilizes the efficient sampling algorithms of DPPs to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs. We evaluate the induced clusters in the context of the three tasks and show results that are superior to strong baselines for each 1.</p><p>4 0.52984297 <a title="268-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Opinion_Words_and_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Two-Stage_Framework.html">244 acl-2013-Mining Opinion Words and Opinion Targets in a Two-Stage Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Liheng Xu ; Kang Liu ; Siwei Lai ; Yubo Chen ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage method for mining opinion words and opinion targets. In the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. Then random walking is employed to estimate confidence of candidates, which improves extraction accuracy by considering confidence of patterns. In the second stage, we adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out high-frequency noise terms and capturing the long-tail terms, which are not investigated by previous methods. The experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with stateof-the-art unsupervised methods.</p><p>5 0.52360457 <a title="268-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Adaptive_Online_Training_of_Feature-Rich_Translation_Models.html">156 acl-2013-Fast and Adaptive Online Training of Feature-Rich Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Spence Green ; Sida Wang ; Daniel Cer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast and scalable online method for tuning statistical machine translation models with large feature sets. The standard tuning algorithm—MERT—only scales to tens of features. Recent discriminative algorithms that accommodate sparse features have produced smaller than expected translation quality gains in large systems. Our method, which is based on stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate, scales to millions of features and tuning sets with tens of thousands of sentences, while still converging after only a few epochs. Large-scale experiments on Arabic-English and Chinese-English show that our method produces significant translation quality gains by exploiting sparse features. Equally important is our analysis, which suggests techniques for mitigating overfitting and domain mismatch, and applies to other recent discriminative methods for machine translation. 1</p><p>6 0.51376784 <a title="268-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Diathesis_alternation_approximation_for_verb_clustering.html">119 acl-2013-Diathesis alternation approximation for verb clustering</a></p>
