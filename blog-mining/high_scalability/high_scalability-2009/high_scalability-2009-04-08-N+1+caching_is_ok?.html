<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>4 0.12233895 <a title="561-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>

thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>4 0.6211766 <a title="561-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-28-How_to_Organize_a_Database_Table%E2%80%99s_Keys_for_Scalability.html">476 high scalability-2008-12-28-How to Organize a Database Table’s Keys for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data
is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large
singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you
have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each
individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all
shards.There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys
across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should
be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.60742635 <a title="561-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate

the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific

<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with
recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem. The problem being that
if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be
used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from
widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the
details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?). If you have
100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.I can see
why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching? i.e. If you run the
first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it
from the cache. Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good? Assuming of course
that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the
cache.I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously
implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data that are in use

Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo

<p>Introduction: John Zachman (Father of enterprise architecture)Given this renascent interest,
who better to explain the principles behind Enterprise Architecture than the
man himself, John Zachman, the originator of the " Zachman Framework for
Enterprise Architecture" Join this workshop in Johannesburg 25th Mar 09 and
Cape town in 27th March 09 and Mr.Zachman will explain how and why Enterprise
Architecture provides measure, such an implementation is a daunting task with
opportunities to fail lurking in many places.For more details visit
