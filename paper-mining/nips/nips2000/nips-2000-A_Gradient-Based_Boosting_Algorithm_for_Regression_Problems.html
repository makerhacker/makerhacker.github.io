<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>3 0.15677994 <a title="3-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Some_New_Bounds_on_the_Generalization_Error_of_Combined_Classifiers.html">119 nips-2000-Some New Bounds on the Generalization Error of Combined Classifiers</a></p>
<p>Author: Vladimir Koltchinskii, Dmitriy Panchenko, Fernando Lozano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop the method of bounding the generalization error of a classifier in terms of its margin distribution which was introduced in the recent papers of Bartlett and Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. The theory of Gaussian and empirical processes allow us to prove the margin type inequalities for the most general functional classes, the complexity of the class being measured via the so called Gaussian complexity functions. As a simple application of our results, we obtain the bounds of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee for the generalization error of boosting. We also substantially improve the results of Bartlett on bounding the generalization error of neural networks in terms of h -norms of the weights of neurons. Furthermore, under additional assumptions on the complexity of the class of hypotheses we provide some tighter bounds, which in the case of boosting improve the results of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. 1 Introduction and margin type inequalities for general functional classes Let (X, Y) be a random couple, where X is an instance in a space Sand Y E {-I, I} is a label. Let 9 be a set of functions from S into JR. For 9 E g, sign(g(X)) will be used as a predictor (a classifier) of the unknown label Y. If the distribution of (X, Y) is unknown, then the choice of the predictor is based on the training data (Xl, Y l ), ... , (Xn, Y n ) that consists ofn i.i.d. copies of (X, Y). The goal ofleaming is to find a predictor 9 E 9 (based on the training data) whose generalization (classification) error JP'{Yg(X) :::; O} is small enough. We will first introduce some probabilistic bounds for general functional classes and then give several examples of their applications to bounding the generalization error of boosting and neural networks. We omit all the proofs and refer an interested reader to [5]. Let (8, A, P) be a probability space and let F be a class of measurable functions from (8, A) into lR. Let {Xd be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables taking values in (8, A) with common distribution P.

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.10039826 <a title="3-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Curves_for_Gaussian_Processes_Regression%3A_A_Framework_for_Good_Approximations.html">77 nips-2000-Learning Curves for Gaussian Processes Regression: A Framework for Good Approximations</a></p>

<p>Author: Milind R. Naphade, Igor Kozintsev, Thomas S. Huang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework for semantic video indexing. We define probabilistic multimedia objects (multijects) to map low-level media features to high-level semantic labels. A graphical network of such multijects (multinet) captures scene context by discovering intra-frame as well as inter-frame dependency relations between the concepts. The main contribution is a novel application of a factor graph framework to model this network. We model relations between semantic concepts in terms of their co-occurrence as well as the temporal dependencies between these concepts within video shots. Using the sum-product algorithm [1] for approximate or exact inference in these factor graph multinets, we attempt to correct errors made during isolated concept detection by forcing high-level constraints. This results in a significant improvement in the overall detection performance. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.98012918 <a title="3-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-A_Gradient-Based_Boosting_Algorithm_for_Regression_Problems.html">3 nips-2000-A Gradient-Based Boosting Algorithm for Regression Problems</a></p>

These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables. This problem is of interest both for improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that guides the learning procedure towards promising models. A very natural approach is to search for</p><p>5 0.85537529 <a title="3-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Sequentially_Fitting_%60%60Inclusive%27%27_Trees_for_Inference_in_Noisy-OR_Networks.html">115 nips-2000-Sequentially Fitting ``Inclusive'' Trees for Inference in Noisy-OR Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Relu Patrascu, Tommi Jaakkola, Jodi Moran</p><p>Abstract: An important class of problems can be cast as inference in noisyOR Bayesian networks, where the binary state of each variable is a logical OR of noisy versions of the states of the variable's parents. For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the symptom - on some occasions, a disease may fail to activate the symptom. Inference in richly-connected noisy-OR networks is intractable, but approximate methods (e .g., variational techniques) are showing increasing promise as practical solutions. One problem with most approximations is that they tend to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes in the true posterior, ignoring other plausible configurations of the hidden variables. We introduce a new sequential variational method for bipartite noisyOR networks, that favors including all modes of the true posterior and models the posterior distribution as a tree. We compare this method with other approximations using an ensemble of networks with network statistics that are comparable to the QMR-DT medical diagnostic network. 1 Inclusive variational approximations Approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference are gaining in popularity and are now even being incorporated into VLSI hardware (T. Richardson, personal communication). Approximate methods include variational techniques (Ghahramani and Jordan 1997; Saul et al. 1996; Frey and Hinton 1999; Jordan et al. 1999), local probability propagation (Gallager 1963; Pearl 1988; Frey 1998; MacKay 1999a; Freeman and Weiss 2001) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (Neal 1993; MacKay 1999b). Many algorithms have been proposed in each of these classes. One problem that most of the above algorithms suffer from is a tendency to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes of the target distribution (the distribution being approximated). In the case of medical diagnosis, different modes correspond to different explanations of the symptoms. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are usually guaranteed to eventually sample from all the modes, but this may take an extremely long time, even when tempered transitions (Neal 1996) are (a) ,,</p><p>6 0.8022126 <a title="3-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>
