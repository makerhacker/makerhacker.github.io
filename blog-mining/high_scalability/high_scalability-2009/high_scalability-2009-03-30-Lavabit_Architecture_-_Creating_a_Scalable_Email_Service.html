<p>Introduction: With Lavabit  shutting down  under  murky circumstances , it seems fitting to  repost an old  (2009), yet still very good post by  Ladar Levison  on Lavabit's architecture. I don't know how much of this information is still current, but it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.
  
 Getting to Know You 
 What is the name of your system and where can we find out more about it? 

 Note: these links are no longer valid... 


Lavabit   http://lavabit.com      http://lavabit.com/network.html    http://lavabit.com/about.html 

 What is your system for? 

Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about 140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email services to approximately 70 companies.

 Why did you decide to build this system? 

We built the system to compete against the other large free email providers, with an emphasis on serving the privacy c</p><p>3 0.13068821 <a title="551-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator_Architecture.html">221 high scalability-2008-01-24-Mailinator Architecture</a></p>

 iDoneThis  is a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day to ask, "What'd you get done today?"  Just reply with a few lines of what you got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and kickstart another awesome day.
 
Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a weekend in the most rudimentary way possible.  I kid you not, we sent the first few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox.  The upshot is that we’ve had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.
 
We’ve gone from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming emails per month.  In total, customers have recorded over 1.</p><p>6 0.088945575 <a title="551-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-19-Building_a_email_communication_system.html">253 high scalability-2008-02-19-Building a email communication system</a></p>

<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>4 0.76740485 <a title="551-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis_-_Scaling_an_Email-based_App_from_Scratch.html">1269 high scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis - Scaling an Email-based App from Scratch</a></p>

In total, customers have recorded over 1.</p><p>5 0.76659232 <a title="551-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-18-Scaling_Mailbox_-_From_0_to_One_Million_Users_in_6_Weeks_and_100_Million_Messages_Per_Day.html">1477 high scalability-2013-06-18-Scaling Mailbox - From 0 to One Million Users in 6 Weeks and 100 Million Messages Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of your  early blog posts  deal with the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly waiting to download your product. That's the enviable position  Mailbox , a free mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle. 
 
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million users in a paltry six weeks with a team of  about 14 people . As of April they were delivering over  100 million messages per day .
 
How did they do it? Mailbox engineering lead,  Sean Beausoleil , gave an  informative interview on readwrite.com  on how Mailbox planned to scale... 
  
  Gather signals early . A pre-release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly.  
  Have something unique . The average person might not think a mailbox app</p><p>6 0.71960938 <a title="551-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We saw in  Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?  scaling social networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,  Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains , from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they call  One-Hop Replication  (OHR). OHR  abstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up from the social network application . The abstract:   
 Online Social Networks (OSN) face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity. To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore, avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some</p><p>2 0.9939881 <a title="551-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>3 0.99356443 <a title="551-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3%2C_2010.html">967 high scalability-2011-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ladar Levison of Lavabit has written an  incredible article on how  they took a centralized off-the-shelf email server that could handle only few thousand users and built their own custom distributed infrastructure for handling hundreds of thousands of email users.  Lavabit processes 70 gigabytes of data per day, is made up of 26 servers, hosts 260,000 email addresses, and processes 600,000 emails a day. That's a lot of email.   Lavabit's mission has a little edge to it too:
   Lavabit was founded as a direct reaction to the larger free e-mail services available. We felt it was possible to create an e-mail service that was fast, reliable, feature rich and didn't achieve profitability by prostituting its user base to marketers.   
What I really like about this article is that Lavabit has some challenging elements in dealing with different email protocols while being able to scale to a lot of users. There's more going on than just trying to scale out a database.
