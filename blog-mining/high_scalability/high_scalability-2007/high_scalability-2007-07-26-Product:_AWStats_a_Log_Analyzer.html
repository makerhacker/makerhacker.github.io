<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the great  MapReduce Versus Database War , you would be correct.   Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each machine approach,  to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability potential.
 
Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each individual machine.

Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not making headway.

I wouldn’t say we panicked, but the office was certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.

<p>Introduction: Web Log Storming  is an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows. The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and how it fits into your desired scenario.  Web Log Storming does far more than just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.  In other words, analyze your web logs like never before!   It's easy to track sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed.

<p>Introduction: This JoelOnSoftware  thread  asks the age old question of what and how to log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large scale distributed system. Instead, you need to  log everything all the time  so you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge range of servers. Yes, it can be done.  To see why the typical logging approach is broken,  imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it. Now.  So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter,  web server, database server,</p><p>6 0.23025817 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Product%3A_Smart_Inspect.html">541 high scalability-2009-03-16-Product: Smart Inspect</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Smart Inspect  has added quite a few features specifically tailored to high scalability and high performance environments to our tool over the years. This includes the ability to log to memory and dump log files on demand (when a crash occurs for example), special backlog queue features, a log service application for central log storage and a lot more. Additionally, our SmartInspect Console (the viewer application) makes viewing, filtering and inspecting large amounts of logging data a lot easier/practical.</p><p>3 0.85757041 <a title="30-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in terms of scalability. The  paper  describes a new technology by the startup company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction of the cost of earlier possibilities.  Complete Genomics is building the worldâ&euro;&trade;s largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey, outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.  By 2010, their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30 petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.

<p>Introduction: AWStats  is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>4 0.55976987 <a title="30-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-10-Can_cloud_computing_smite_down_evil_zombie_botnet_armies%3F.html">349 high scalability-2008-07-10-Can cloud computing smite down evil zombie botnet armies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>5 0.54123336 <a title="30-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations.  Jeremy Cole in   On efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GIS   succinctly explains the many uses for such a feature:     Geo-referencing IPs is, in a nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more applications.       This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-rereferncing data, how to load data,  and the performance of different approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to the subject.</p><p>6 0.53721869 <a title="30-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
