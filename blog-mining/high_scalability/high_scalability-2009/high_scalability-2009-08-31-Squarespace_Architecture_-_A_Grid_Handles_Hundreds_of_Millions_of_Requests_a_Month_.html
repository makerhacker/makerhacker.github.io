</p><p>3 Serves hundreds of millions of hits per month. [sent-20, score-0.267]
</p><p>4 These end up costing more in the long run as datacenter power is extremely expensive. [sent-33, score-0.211]
</p><p>5 Cacti -  a cacti instance is used to graph statistical data which helps see trends over time, predict when a hardware upgrade is necessary, and troubleshoot any problems that do show up. [sent-34, score-0.392]
</p><p>6 Don't be afraid to spend money on technology that helps you get where you need to go. [sent-51, score-0.181]
</p><p>7 It can save you months and months of headaches that would have prevented you from working on core functionality. [sent-52, score-0.21]
</p><p>8 Even larger sites with millions of inbound hits per day are servable, as the bulk of the traffic serving on those sites is in the media being served. [sent-65, score-0.508]
</p><p>9 Because of this, we're luckily not in a situation where we need to keep getting bigger and beefier hardware to handle more and more traffic -- we try to scale out by supplementing the grid. [sent-69, score-0.259]
</p><p>10 Since we try to cache as much as we can and every server participates in handling requests for every site, it's generally just a matter of adding another node to the environment. [sent-70, score-0.419]
</p><p>11 We try to apply this simplicity to every part of our infrastructure, both with our own software and when deciding on purchases from outside vendors. [sent-71, score-0.211]
</p><p>12 For instance, we just increased the amount of available storage another few terabytes by adding another node to our Isilon cluster. [sent-72, score-0.213]
</p><p>13 We, unfortunately, can't share these numbers as we're a private company -- but we can say we have tens of thousands of customers, hundreds of thousands of signups, and serve hundreds of millions of hits per month. [sent-75, score-0.735]
</p><p>14 I will say we don't purchase "commodity nodes" or other low cost hardware units, as we find these end up costing more in the long run as datacenter power is extremely expensive. [sent-78, score-0.293]
</p><p>15 As mentioned above, every web node handles traffic for all sites, so a customer doesn't have to worry about an underpowered server unable to handle their traffic, or a node going down. [sent-92, score-0.447]
</p><p>16 Our monitoring systems check every aspect of our environment we can think of several times a minute, and can restart obviously dead services, or alert us if it's something an actual person needs to handle. [sent-100, score-0.28]
</p><p>17 This allows us to easily predict when a hardware upgrade is necessary. [sent-102, score-0.23]
</p><p>18 One thing (amongst many) that has consistently served us very well is trying to ensure our development environment is always releasable into production. [sent-115, score-0.216]
</p><p>19 We try and get every single customer support inquiry answered within 15 minutes or less, and have all sorts of metrics related to our goals here. [sent-123, score-0.208]
</p><p>20 Some of our choices for load balancing and storage are very costly, but end up saving us months and months of time in the long haul, as we've avoided having to "put out fires" generated by untested home grown solutions. [sent-130, score-0.415]

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary. Thanks for the thought though.  It's been a long long long process. Importing a largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things. I'll explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia that needs to be handled to make the move complete:

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement of  Squarespace  streaming from the ubiquitous  Leo Laporte  on one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as a  fully hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website, blog or portfolio  was of interest to me because they promise scalability and this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.  When a fine reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge,  (and all my readers are thrifty, brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and myself. Answers can be found below.  Two things struck me most about Squarespace's approach:

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Donâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival.

<p>Introduction: Update 2: 3tera has added  Dynamic Appliances , which are "packaged data center operations like backup, migration or SLAs that users can add to their applications to provide functionality."    Update: in an effort to help cross the chasm of how start building a website using their grid OS, 3tera is offering their  Assured Success Plan . The idea is to provide training, consulting, and support so you can get started with some confidence you'll end up succeeding.  
 
If you are starting or extending a website you have a problem: what technologies should you use?   Now there are more answers to that question than ever. One new and refreshingly innovative answer is  3tera 's grid OS. In this podcast interview with Bert Armijo from 3tera, we'll learn how 3tera wants to change how you build websites.
 
How? By transforming the physical into the virtual and then allowing the virtual to be manipulated as if it were real. Could I possibly be more abstract? Not really.

<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinating  slam by slam recount  of how his  FaceStat  (upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000 page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning the  Great Eye  of the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such events in  The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture : massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly FaceStat's situation.   This is also one of our first exposures to an application written on Merb, a popular Ruby on Rails competitor.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Andy Gelfond , VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site. There's an update for this article at  An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment .  
 
For  TripAdvisor , scalability is woven into our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture, development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable co</p><p>6 0.82313514 <a title="691-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-How_to_Succeed_at_Capacity_Planning_Without_Really_Trying_%3A__An_Interview_with_Flickr%27s_John_Allspaw_on_His_New_Book.html">643 high scalability-2009-06-29-How to Succeed at Capacity Planning Without Really Trying :  An Interview with Flickr's John Allspaw on His New Book</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Siddharth Anand , a senior member of LinkedIn's Distributed Data Systems team.  
 
Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of  supporting the needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.
 
In 2010, I helped Netflix to successfully   transition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB  , AWS' hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions -- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the other in Ireland ( F1 ). Both of these transitions have been successful, but have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database replication technology.

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for performing very high level operations quite simply.  Vagrant  is such a tool for  building and distributing virtualized development environments .
  

Web developers use virtual environments every day with their web   applications. From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such   as EngineYard and Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for  easy  deployment and infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take  those  very same principles and put them to work in the heart of the   application lifecycle. By providing easy to configure, lightweight,   reproducible, and portable virtual machines targeted at development   environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity and flexibility.

  
If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant does a lot of the work for you:

<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra;  Reddit outages  were linked to Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but not naked.
 
 (Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so it's worth it :-) 
 
Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to Twitter,  which came out with a post,  Cassandra  at Twitter Today , explaining that they are using Cassandra in  production for geolocation and analytics.

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement of  Squarespace  streaming from the ubiquitous  Leo Laporte  on one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as a  fully hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website, blog or portfolio  was of interest to me because they promise scalability and this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.  When a fine reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge,  (and all my readers are thrifty, brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and myself. Answers can be found below.  Two things struck me most about Squarespace's approach:

<p>Introduction: It's been awhile since I've said anything about collectl and I wanted to let this group know I'm currently working on an interface to ganglia since I've seen a variety of posts ranging from how much data to log and where to log it as well as which tools/mechanism to use for logging.  From my perspective there are essentially 2 camps on the monitoring front - one says to have distributed agents all sending their data to a central point, but don't send too much or too often.  The other camp (which is the one I'm in) says do it all locally with a highly efficient data collector, because you need a lot of data (I also read a post in here about logging everything) and you can't possibly monitors 100s or 1Ks of nodes remotely at the granularity necessary to get anything meaningful.     Enter collectl and its evolving interface for ganglia.  This will allow you to log lots of detailed data on local nodes at the usual 10 sec interval (or more frequent if you prefer) at about 0.1% system overhe</p><p>6 0.96944356 <a title="691-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_5%2C_2011.html">1093 high scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 5, 2011</a></p>
