<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and

<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical
conference: COLT.Bayesian LearningBayes law is always used. Focus on methods
of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and
practical applications. Typical conferences: NIPS,UAIStructured
learningPredicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical
conferences: NIPS, UAI, othersReinforcement LearningFocused on 'agent-in-the-
world' learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward. Typical
conferences: ICMLUnsupervised Learning/Clustering/Dimensionality

<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation
and theoretical understanding.MethodK-fold cross validation is a commonly used
technique which takes a set ofmexamples and partitions them intoKsets
("folds") of sizem/K. For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other
folds and then test on the fold.ProblemAssume only independent samples. Derive
a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error
rate.Past Work(I'll add more as I remember/learn.)Devroye, Rogers, and Wagner
analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds. Not all of this
is online, but here is onepaper.Michael KearnsandDana Ronanalyzed cross
validationand found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for
the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test
set of sizem/K.Avrim Blum,Adam Kalai, andmyselfanalyzed cross validationand
found that you can do at least as well as a test set of sizem/Kwith no

<p>Introduction: "Overfitting" is traditionally defined as training some flexible
representation so that it memorizes the data but fails to predict well in the
future. For this post, I will define overfitting more generally as over-
representing the performance of systems. There are two styles of general
overfitting: overrepresenting performance on particular datasets and
(implicitly) overrepresenting performance of a method on future datasets.We
should all be aware of these methods, avoid them where possible, and take them
into account otherwise. I have used "reproblem" and "old datasets", and may
have participated in "overfitting by review"--some of these are very difficult
to avoid.NameMethodExplanationRemedyTraditional overfittingTrain a complex
predictor on too-few examples.Hold out pristine examples for testing.Use a
simpler predictor.Get more training examples.Integrate over many
predictors.Reject papers which do this.Parameter tweak overfittingUse a
learning algorithm with many parameters. Choo</p><p>6 0.12894428 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>4 0.60747027 <a title="44-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of

<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>6 0.60427725 <a title="44-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-06-MLTV.html">146 hunch net-2006-01-06-MLTV</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most confusing things about understanding learning theory is the
vast array of differing assumptions. Some critical thought about which of
these assumptions are reasonable for real-world problems may be useful.Before
we even start thinking about assumptions, it's important to realize that the
word hasmultiple meanings. The meaning used here is "assumption = axiom" (i.e.
something you can not verify).AssumptionReasonable?Which

<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is a field with an impressively diverse set of reseearch
styles. Understanding this may be important in appreciating what you see at a
conference.Engineering. How can I solve this problem? People in the
engineering research style try to solve hard problems directly by any means
available and then describe how they did it. This is typical of problem-
specific conferences and communities.Scientific. What are the principles for
solving learning problems? People in this research style test techniques on
many different problems. This is fairly common at ICML and NIPS.Mathematical.
How can the learning problem be mathematically understood? People in this
research style prove theorems with implications for learning but often do not
implement (or test algorithms). COLT is a typical conference for this
style.Many people manage to cross these styles, and that is often
beneficial.Whenver we list a set of alternative, it becomes natural to think
"which is best?" In this case of le</p><p>5 0.78787714 <a title="44-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>6 0.78230673 <a title="44-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-27-Learning_Complete_Problems.html">6 hunch net-2005-01-27-Learning Complete Problems</a></p>
