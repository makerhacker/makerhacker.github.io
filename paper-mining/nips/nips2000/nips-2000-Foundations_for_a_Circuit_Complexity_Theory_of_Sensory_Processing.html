<p>Author: Susanne Still, Bernhard Schölkopf, Klaus Hepp, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: To control the walking gaits of a four-legged robot we present a novel neuromorphic VLSI chip that coordinates the relative phasing of the robot's legs similar to how spinal Central Pattern Generators are believed to control vertebrate locomotion [3]. The chip controls the leg movements by driving motors with time varying voltages which are the outputs of a small network of coupled oscillators. The characteristics of the chip's output voltages depend on a set of input parameters. The relationship between input parameters and output voltages can be computed analytically for an idealized system. In practice, however, this ideal relationship is only approximately true due to transistor mismatch and offsets. Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning algorithm introduced recently [7]. The learning requires only that the description of the desired output is given. The machine learns from (unlabeled) examples how to set the parameters to the chip in order to obtain a desired motor behavior.</p><p>6 0.06853234 <a title="56-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Dendritic_Compartmentalization_Could_Underlie_Competition_and_Attentional_Biasing_of_Simultaneous_Visual_Stimuli.html">40 nips-2000-Dendritic Compartmentalization Could Underlie Competition and Attentional Biasing of Simultaneous Visual Stimuli</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The paradigm of Hebbian learning has recently received a novel interpretation with the discovery of synaptic plasticity that depends on the relative timing of pre and post synaptic spikes. This paper derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic principle of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to the experimentally observed plasticity. We find that a supervised spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the experimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a stable near optimal level. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is determined by the temporal filter applied by neurons over their inputs. These results suggest experimental prediction as to the dependency of the learning rule on neuronal biophysical parameters 1</p><p>3 0.50249821 <a title="56-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-What_Can_a_Single_Neuron_Compute%3F.html">146 nips-2000-What Can a Single Neuron Compute?</a></p>
<p>Author: Blaise Agüera y Arcas, Adrienne L. Fairhall, William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we formulate a description of the computation performed by a neuron as a combination of dimensional reduction and nonlinearity. We implement this description for the HodgkinHuxley model, identify the most relevant dimensions and find the nonlinearity. A two dimensional description already captures a significant fraction of the information that spikes carry about dynamic inputs. This description also shows that computation in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is more complex than a simple integrateand-fire or perceptron model. 1</p><p>4 0.50156796 <a title="56-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Balancing_Multiple_Sources_of_Reward_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">28 nips-2000-Balancing Multiple Sources of Reward in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: For many problems which would be natural for reinforcement learning, the reward signal is not a single scalar value but has multiple scalar components. Examples of such problems include agents with multiple goals and agents with multiple users. Creating a single reward value by combining the multiple components can throwaway vital information and can lead to incorrect solutions. We describe the multiple reward source problem and discuss the problems with applying traditional reinforcement learning. We then present an new algorithm for finding a solution and results on simulated environments.</p><p>5 0.4979232 <a title="56-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Productive%2C_Systematic_Framework_for_the_Representation_of_Visual_Structure.html">10 nips-2000-A Productive, Systematic Framework for the Representation of Visual Structure</a></p>
