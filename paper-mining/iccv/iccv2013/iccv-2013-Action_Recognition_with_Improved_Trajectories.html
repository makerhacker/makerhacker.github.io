<p>Author: Jiaming Guo, Zhuwen Li, Loong-Fah Cheong, Steven Zhiying Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given a pair of videos having a common action, our goal is to simultaneously segment this pair of videos to extract this common action. As a preprocessing step, we first remove background trajectories by a motion-based figureground segmentation. To remove the remaining background and those extraneous actions, we propose the trajectory cosaliency measure, which captures the notion that trajectories recurring in all the videos should have their mutual saliency boosted. This requires a trajectory matching process which can compare trajectories with different lengths and not necessarily spatiotemporally aligned, and yet be discriminative enough despite significant intra-class variation in the common action. We further leverage the graph matching to enforce geometric coherence between regions so as to reduce feature ambiguity and matching errors. Finally, to classify the trajectories into common action and action outliers, we formulate the problem as a binary labeling of a Markov Random Field, in which the data term is measured by the trajectory co-saliency and the smooth- ness term is measured by the spatiotemporal consistency between trajectories. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we introduce a dataset containing clips that have animal actions as well as human actions. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in common action extraction.</p><p>3 0.38340977 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Camera_Alignment_Using_Trajectory_Intersections_in_Unsynchronized_Videos.html">68 iccv-2013-Camera Alignment Using Trajectory Intersections in Unsynchronized Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Kuo, Santhoshkumar Sunderrajan, B.S. Manjunath</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the novel and challenging problem of aligning camera views that are unsynchronized by low and/or variable frame rates using object trajectories. Unlike existing trajectory-based alignment methods, our method does not require frame-to-frame synchronization. Instead, we propose using the intersections of corresponding object trajectories to match views. To find these intersections, we introduce a novel trajectory matching algorithm based on matching Spatio-Temporal Context Graphs (STCGs). These graphs represent the distances between trajectories in time and space within a view, and are matched to an STCG from another view to find the corresponding trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to align views that are unsynchronized with variable frame rates. The results on simulated and real-world datasets show trajectory intersections area viablefeatureforcamera alignment, and that the trajectory matching method performs well in real-world scenarios.</p><p>4 0.36805829 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Trajectory_Clustering_for_Motion_Segmentation.html">361 iccv-2013-Robust Trajectory Clustering for Motion Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Shi, Zhong Zhou, Jiangjian Xiao, Wei Wu</p><p>Abstract: Due to occlusions and objects ’ non-rigid deformation in the scene, the obtained motion trajectories from common trackers may contain a number of missing or mis-associated entries. To cluster such corrupted point based trajectories into multiple motions is still a hard problem. In this paper, we present an approach that exploits temporal and spatial characteristics from tracked points to facilitate segmentation of incomplete and corrupted trajectories, thereby obtain highly robust results against severe data missing and noises. Our method first uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) bases as a temporal smoothness constraint on trajectory projection to ensure the validity of resulting components to repair pathological trajectories. Then, based on an observation that the trajectories of foreground and background in a scene may have different spatial distributions, we propose a two-stage clustering strategy that first performs foreground-background separation then segments remaining foreground trajectories. We show that, with this new clustering strategy, sequences with complex motions can be accurately segmented by even using a simple trans- lational model. Finally, a series of experiments on Hopkins 155 dataset andBerkeley motion segmentation dataset show the advantage of our method over other state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and robustness.</p><p>5 0.36589891 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Online_Motion_Segmentation_Using_Dynamic_Label_Propagation.html">297 iccv-2013-Online Motion Segmentation Using Dynamic Label Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>6 0.33853418 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Action_and_Event_Recognition_with_Fisher_Vectors_on_a_Compact_Feature_Set.html">40 iccv-2013-Action and Event Recognition with Fisher Vectors on a Compact Feature Set</a></p>

<p>Author: Saad Ali</p><p>Abstract: In this paper a notion of flow complexity that measures the amount of interaction among objects is introduced and an approach to compute it directly from a video sequence is proposed. The approach employs particle trajectories as the input representation of motion and maps it into a ‘braid’ based representation. The mapping is based on the observation that 2D trajectories of particles take the form of a braid in space-time due to the intermingling among particles over time. As a result of this mapping, the problem of estimating the flow complexity from particle trajectories becomes the problem of estimating braid complexity, which in turn can be computed by measuring the topological entropy of a braid. For this purpose recently developed mathematical tools from braid theory are employed which allow rapid computation of topological entropy of braids. The approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of open source videos depicting variations in terms of types of moving objects, scene layout, camera view angle, motion patterns, and object densities. The results show that the proposed approach is able to quantify the complexity of the flow, and at the same time provides useful insights about the sources of the complexity.</p><p>5 0.80720818 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Trajectory_Clustering_for_Motion_Segmentation.html">361 iccv-2013-Robust Trajectory Clustering for Motion Segmentation</a></p>

Solving this type of blur is of unique practical importance since nearly all car, traffic and bike-mounted cameras follow out-ofplane translational motion. We start with the study of geometric models and analyze the difficulty of existing methods to deal with them. We also propose a solution accounting for depth variation. Homographies associated with different 3D planes are considered and solved for in an optimization framework. Our method is verified on several natural image examples that cannot be satisfyingly dealt with by previous methods.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.93242985 <a title="39-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Action_Recognition_with_Improved_Trajectories.html">39 iccv-2013-Action Recognition with Improved Trajectories</a></p>

Experimental results onfour challenging action datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50) significantly outperform the current state of the art.</p><p>3 0.92847013 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_People_Detectors_for_Tracking_in_Crowded_Scenes.html">242 iccv-2013-Learning People Detectors for Tracking in Crowded Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Siyu Tang, Mykhaylo Andriluka, Anton Milan, Konrad Schindler, Stefan Roth, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: People tracking in crowded real-world scenes is challenging due to frequent and long-term occlusions. Recent tracking methods obtain the image evidence from object (people) detectors, but typically use off-the-shelf detectors and treat them as black box components. In this paper we argue that for best performance one should explicitly train people detectors on failure cases of the overall tracker instead. To that end, we first propose a novel joint people detector that combines a state-of-the-art single person detector with a detector for pairs of people, which explicitly exploits common patterns of person-person occlusions across multiple viewpoints that are a frequent failure case for tracking in crowded scenes. To explicitly address remaining failure modes of the tracker we explore two methods. First, we analyze typical failures of trackers and train a detector explicitly on these cases. And second, we train the detector with the people tracker in the loop, focusing on the most common tracker failures. We show that our joint multi-person detector significantly improves both de- tection accuracy as well as tracker performance, improving the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks.</p><p>4 0.92753321 <a title="39-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_Revisited_Using_RGBD_Camera%3A_Unified_Benchmark_and_Baselines.html">424 iccv-2013-Tracking Revisited Using RGBD Camera: Unified Benchmark and Baselines</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuran Song, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collectedandannotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu.</p><p>5 0.92698264 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Tracking_via_Robust_Multi-task_Multi-view_Joint_Sparse_Representation.html">425 iccv-2013-Tracking via Robust Multi-task Multi-view Joint Sparse Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhibin Hong, Xue Mei, Danil Prokhorov, Dacheng Tao</p><p>Abstract: Combining multiple observation views has proven beneficial for tracking. In this paper, we cast tracking as a novel multi-task multi-view sparse learning problem and exploit the cues from multiple views including various types of visual features, such as intensity, color, and edge, where each feature observation can be sparsely represented by a linear combination of atoms from an adaptive feature dictionary. The proposed method is integrated in a particle filter framework where every view in each particle is regarded as an individual task. We jointly consider the underlying relationship between tasks across different views and different particles, and tackle it in a unified robust multi-task formulation. In addition, to capture the frequently emerging outlier tasks, we decompose the representation matrix to two collaborative components which enable a more robust and accurate approximation. We show that theproposedformulation can be efficiently solved using the Accelerated Proximal Gradient method with a small number of closed-form updates. The presented tracker is implemented using four types of features and is tested on numerous benchmark video sequences. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to several stateof-the-art trackers.</p><p>6 0.92442721 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Initialization-Insensitive_Visual_Tracking_through_Voting_with_Salient_Local_Features.html">217 iccv-2013-Initialization-Insensitive Visual Tracking through Voting with Salient Local Features</a></p>
