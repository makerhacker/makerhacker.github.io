<p>Author: Michaela Regneri ; Rui Wang</p><p>Abstract: Previous work on paraphrase extraction using parallel or comparable corpora has generally not considered the documents’ discourse structure as a useful information source. We propose a novel method for collecting paraphrases relying on the sequential event order in the discourse, using multiple sequence alignment with a semantic similarity measure. We show that adding discourse information boosts the performance of sentence-level paraphrase acquisition, which consequently gives a tremendous advantage for extracting phraselevel paraphrase fragments from matched sentences. Our system beats an informed baseline by a margin of 50%.</p><p>3 0.23917495 <a title="16-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2012-Generalizing_Sub-sentential_Paraphrase_Acquisition_across_Original_Signal_Type_of_Text_Pairs.html">58 emnlp-2012-Generalizing Sub-sentential Paraphrase Acquisition across Original Signal Type of Text Pairs</a></p>

<p>Author: Shujie Liu ; Chi-Ho Li ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: The training of most syntactic SMT approaches involves two essential components, word alignment and monolingual parser. In the current state of the art these two components are mutually independent, thus causing problems like lack of rule generalization, and violation of syntactic correspondence in translation rules. In this paper, we propose two ways of re-training monolingual parser with the target of maximizing the consistency between parse trees and alignment matrices. One is targeted self-training with a simple evaluation function; the other is based on training data selection from forced alignment of bilingual data. We also propose an auxiliary method for boosting alignment quality, by symmetrizing alignment matrices with respect to parse trees. The best combination of these novel methods achieves 3 Bleu point gain in an IWSLT task and more than 1 Bleu point gain in NIST tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.17591234 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2012-Enlarging_Paraphrase_Collections_through_Generalization_and_Instantiation.html">39 emnlp-2012-Enlarging Paraphrase Collections through Generalization and Instantiation</a></p>
<p>Author: Atsushi Fujita ; Pierre Isabelle ; Roland Kuhn</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a paraphrase acquisition method that uncovers and exploits generalities underlying paraphrases: paraphrase patterns are first induced and then used to collect novel instances. Unlike existing methods, ours uses both bilingual parallel and monolingual corpora. While the former are regarded as a source of high-quality seed paraphrases, the latter are searched for paraphrases that match patterns learned from the seed paraphrases. We show how one can use monolingual corpora, which are far more numerous and larger than bilingual corpora, to obtain paraphrases that rival in quality those derived directly from bilingual corpora. In our experiments, the number of paraphrase pairs obtained in this way from monolingual corpora was a large multiple of the number of seed paraphrases. Human evaluation through a paraphrase substitution test demonstrated that the newly acquired paraphrase pairs are ofreasonable quality. Remaining noise can be further reduced by filtering seed paraphrases.</p><p>6 0.15772875 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Learning_Verb_Inference_Rules_from_Linguistically-Motivated_Evidence.html">80 emnlp-2012-Learning Verb Inference Rules from Linguistically-Motivated Evidence</a></p>

<p>Author: Hila Weisman ; Jonathan Berant ; Idan Szpektor ; Ido Dagan</p><p>Abstract: Learning inference relations between verbs is at the heart of many semantic applications. However, most prior work on learning such rules focused on a rather narrow set of information sources: mainly distributional similarity, and to a lesser extent manually constructed verb co-occurrence patterns. In this paper, we claim that it is imperative to utilize information from various textual scopes: verb co-occurrence within a sentence, verb cooccurrence within a document, as well as overall corpus statistics. To this end, we propose a much richer novel set of linguistically motivated cues for detecting entailment between verbs and combine them as features in a supervised classification framework. We empirically demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous methods and that information from each textual scope contributes to the verb entailment learning task.</p><p>6 0.50381058 <a title="16-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2012-Forced_Derivation_Tree_based_Model_Training_to_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">54 emnlp-2012-Forced Derivation Tree based Model Training to Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jennifer Gillenwater ; Alex Kulesza ; Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic technique for modeling and extracting salient structure from large document collections. As in clustering and topic modeling, our goal is to provide an organizing perspective into otherwise overwhelming amounts of information. We are particularly interested in revealing and exploiting relationships between documents. To this end, we focus on extracting diverse sets of threads—singlylinked, coherent chains of important documents. To illustrate, we extract research threads from citation graphs and construct timelines from news articles. Our method is highly scalable, running on a corpus of over 30 million words in about four minutes, more than 75 times faster than a dynamic topic model. Finally, the results from our model more closely resemble human news summaries according to several metrics and are also preferred by human judges.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70716411 <a title="16-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2012-Aligning_Predicates_across_Monolingual_Comparable_Texts_using_Graph-based_Clustering.html">16 emnlp-2012-Aligning Predicates across Monolingual Comparable Texts using Graph-based Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Hisami Suzuki ; Jianfeng Gao</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an integrated, end-to-end approach to online spelling correction for text input. Online spelling correction refers to the spelling correction as you type, as opposed to post-editing. The online scenario is particularly important for languages that routinely use transliteration-based text input methods, such as Chinese and Japanese, because the desired target characters cannot be input at all unless they are in the list of candidates provided by an input method, and spelling errors prevent them from appearing in the list. For example, a user might type suesheng by mistake to mean xuesheng 学生 'student' in Chinese; existing input methods fail to convert this misspelled input to the desired target Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to the problem of spelling correction and transliteration-based character conversion using an approach inspired by the phrasebased statistical machine translation framework. At the phrase (substring) level, k most probable pinyin (Romanized Chinese) corrections are generated using a monotone decoder; at the sentence level, input pinyin strings are directly transliterated into target Chinese characters by a decoder using a loglinear model that refer to the features of both levels. A new method of automatically deriving parallel training data from user keystroke logs is also presented. Experiments on Chinese pinyin conversion show that our integrated method reduces the character error rate by 20% (from 8.9% to 7. 12%) over the previous state-of-the art based on a noisy channel model. 609 1</p><p>4 0.5271129 <a title="16-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2012-Generalizing_Sub-sentential_Paraphrase_Acquisition_across_Original_Signal_Type_of_Text_Pairs.html">58 emnlp-2012-Generalizing Sub-sentential Paraphrase Acquisition across Original Signal Type of Text Pairs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurelien Max ; Houda Bouamor ; Anne Vilnat</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a study on the impact of the original signal (text, speech, visual scene, event) of a text pair on the task of both manual and automatic sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition. A corpus of 2,500 annotated sentences in English and French is described, and performance on this corpus is reported for an efficient system combination exploiting a large set of features for paraphrase recognition. A detailed quantified typology of subsentential paraphrases found in our corpus types is given.</p><p>5 0.5268603 <a title="16-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Discriminative_Model_for_Query_Spelling_Correction_with_Latent_Structural_SVM.html">5 emnlp-2012-A Discriminative Model for Query Spelling Correction with Latent Structural SVM</a></p>
<p>Author: Huizhong Duan ; Yanen Li ; ChengXiang Zhai ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative training in query spelling correction is difficult due to the complex internal structures of the data. Recent work on query spelling correction suggests a two stage approach a noisy channel model that is used to retrieve a number of candidate corrections, followed by discriminatively trained ranker applied to these candidates. The ranker, however, suffers from the fact the low recall of the first, suboptimal, search stage. This paper proposes to directly optimize the search stage with a discriminative model based on latent structural SVM. In this model, we treat query spelling correction as a multiclass classification problem with structured input and output. The latent structural information is used to model the alignment of words in the spelling correction process. Experiment results show that as a standalone speller, our model outperforms all the baseline systems. It also attains a higher recall compared with the noisy channel model, and can therefore serve as a better filtering stage when combined with a ranker.</p><p>6 0.52656305 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2012-A_Systematic_Comparison_of_Phrase_Table_Pruning_Techniques.html">11 emnlp-2012-A Systematic Comparison of Phrase Table Pruning Techniques</a></p>
