<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>3 0.15803163 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_bilingual_terminologies_from_comparable_corpora.html">154 acl-2013-Extracting bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmet Aker ; Monica Paramita ; Rob Gaizauskas</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a method for extracting bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora. In our approach we treat bilingual term extraction as a classification problem. For classification we use an SVM binary classifier and training data taken from the EUROVOC thesaurus. We test our approach on a held-out test set from EUROVOC and perform precision, recall and f-measure evaluations for 20 European language pairs. The performance of our classifier reaches the 100% precision level for many language pairs. We also perform manual evaluation on bilingual terms extracted from English-German term-tagged comparable corpora. The results of this manual evaluation showed 60-83% of the term pairs generated are exact translations and over 90% exact or partial translations.</p><p>4 0.15164499 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Building_Comparable_Corpora_Based_on_Bilingual_LDA_Model.html">74 acl-2013-Building Comparable Corpora Based on Bilingual LDA Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Zede Zhu ; Miao Li ; Lei Chen ; Zhenxin Yang</p><p>Abstract: Comparable corpora are important basic resources in cross-language information processing. However, the existing methods of building comparable corpora, which use intertranslate words and relative features, cannot evaluate the topical relation between document pairs. This paper adopts the bilingual LDA model to predict the topical structures of the documents and proposes three algorithms of document similarity in different languages. Experiments show that the novel method can obtain similar documents with consistent top- ics own better adaptability and stability performance.</p><p>5 0.13454127 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Context-Dependent_Multilingual_Lexical_Lookup_for_Under-Resourced_Languages.html">92 acl-2013-Context-Dependent Multilingual Lexical Lookup for Under-Resourced Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Lian Tze Lim ; Lay-Ki Soon ; Tek Yong Lim ; Enya Kong Tang ; Bali Ranaivo-Malancon</p><p>Abstract: Current approaches for word sense disambiguation and translation selection typically require lexical resources or large bilingual corpora with rich information fields and annotations, which are often infeasible for under-resourced languages. We extract translation context knowledge from a bilingual comparable corpora of a richer-resourced language pair, and inject it into a multilingual lexicon. The multilin- gual lexicon can then be used to perform context-dependent lexical lookup on texts of any language, including under-resourced ones. Evaluations on a prototype lookup tool, trained on a English–Malay bilingual Wikipedia corpus, show a precision score of 0.65 (baseline 0.55) and mean reciprocal rank score of 0.81 (baseline 0.771). Based on the early encouraging results, the context-dependent lexical lookup tool may be developed further into an intelligent reading aid, to help users grasp the gist of a second or foreign language text.</p><p>6 0.12567358 <a title="93-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>5 0.72388655 <a title="93-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-SenseSpotting%3A_Never_let_your_parallel_data_tie_you_to_an_old_domain.html">316 acl-2013-SenseSpotting: Never let your parallel data tie you to an old domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Hal Daume III ; Katharine Henry ; Ann Irvine ; Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Rachel Rudinger</p><p>Abstract: Words often gain new senses in new domains. Being able to automatically identify, from a corpus of monolingual text, which word tokens are being used in a previously unseen sense has applications to machine translation and other tasks sensitive to lexical semantics. We define a task, SENSESPOTTING, in which we build systems to spot tokens that have new senses in new domain text. Instead of difficult and expensive annotation, we build a goldstandard by leveraging cheaply available parallel corpora, targeting our approach to the problem of domain adaptation for machine translation. Our system is able to achieve F-measures of as much as 80%, when applied to word types it has never seen before. Our approach is based on a large set of novel features that capture varied aspects of how words change when used in new domains.</p><p>6 0.71740484 <a title="93-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Italian_connectives_into_Italian_Sign_Language.html">360 acl-2013-Translating Italian connectives into Italian Sign Language</a></p>

We seek to improve Anand et al.’s (201 1) approach to debate stance classification by modeling two types of soft extra-linguistic constraints on the stance labels of debate posts, user-interaction constraints and ideology constraints.

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Efficiently incorporating entity-level information is a challenge for coreference resolution systems due to the difficulty of exact inference over partitions. We describe an end-to-end discriminative probabilistic model for coreference that, along with standard pairwise features, enforces structural agreement constraints between specified properties of coreferent mentions. This model can be represented as a factor graph for each document that admits efficient inference via belief propagation. We show that our method can use entity-level information to outperform a basic pairwise system.</p><p>4 0.62578779 <a title="93-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Margin-based_Decomposed_Amortized_Inference.html">237 acl-2013-Margin-based Decomposed Amortized Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Gourab Kundu ; Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Given that structured output prediction is typically performed over entire datasets, one natural question is whether it is possible to re-use computation from earlier inference instances to speed up inference for future instances. Amortized inference has been proposed as a way to accomplish this. In this paper, first, we introduce a new amortized inference algorithm called the Margin-based Amortized Inference, which uses the notion of structured margin to identify inference problems for which previous solutions are provably optimal. Second, we introduce decomposed amortized inference, which is designed to address very large inference problems, where earlier amortization methods become less ef- fective. This approach works by decomposing the output structure and applying amortization piece-wise, thus increasing the chance that we can re-use previous solutions for parts of the output structure. These parts are then combined to a global coherent solution using Lagrangian relaxation. In our experiments, using the NLP tasks of semantic role labeling and entityrelation extraction, we demonstrate that with the margin-based algorithm, we need to call the inference engine only for a third of the test examples. Further, we show that the decomposed variant of margin-based amortized inference achieves a greater reduction in the number of inference calls.</p><p>5 0.61603105 <a title="93-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>6 0.6156922 <a title="93-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
