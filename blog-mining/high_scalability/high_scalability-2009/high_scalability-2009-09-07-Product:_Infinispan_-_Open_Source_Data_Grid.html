<p>Introduction: Recently I attended a lecture presented by Manik Surtani , JBoss Cache & Infinispan project lead. The goal of the talk was to provide a technical overview of both products and outline Infinispan's road-map. Infinispan is the successor to the open-source JBoss Cache. JBoss Cache was originally targeted at simple web page caching and Infinispan builds on this to take it into the Cloud paradigm.  Why did I attend? Well, over the past few years I have worked on projects that have used commercial  distributed caching (aka data grid) technologies such as GemFire, GigaSpaces XAP or Oracle Coherence . These projects required more functionality than is currently provided by open-source solutions such as memcached or EHCache. Looking at the road-map for Infinispan, I was struck by its ambition â&euro;&ldquo; will it provide the functionality that I need?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>4 0.13486651 <a title="696-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-21-In_Memory_Data_Grid_Technologies.html">1160 high scalability-2011-12-21-In Memory Data Grid Technologies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer) wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the wider technology community.
 
 What is an In Memory Data Grid? 
 
It is not an in-memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is a different breed of software datastore.
 
In summary an IMDG is an ‘off the shelf’ software product that exhibits the following characteristics:
 
The data model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This distributed model is known as a ‘shared nothing’ architecture.
  
 All servers can be active in each site. 
 All data is stored in the RAM of the servers. 
 Servers can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM available. 
 The data model is non-relational and is object-based.  
 Distributed applications written on the .NET and Java application platforms are s</p><p>5 0.1109203 <a title="696-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ScaleOut StateServer  is an in-memory distributed cache across a server farm or compute grid. Unlike middleware vendors, StateServer is aims at being a very good data cache, it doesn't try to handle job scheduling as well.  StateServer is what you might get when you take Memcached and merge in all the value added distributed caching features you've ever dreamed of. True, Memcached is free and ScaleOut StateServer is very far from free, but for those looking a for a satisfying out-of-the-box experience, StateServer may be just the caching solution you are looking for. Yes, "solution" is one of those "oh my God I'm going to pay through the nose" indicator words, but it really applies here. Memcached is a framework whereas StateServer has already prepackaged most features you would need to add through your own programming efforts.  Why use a distributed cache? Because it combines the holly quadrinity of computing: better performance, linear scalability, high availability, and fast applica</p><p>4 0.70773065 <a title="696-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-16-%5BANN%5D_New_Open_Source_Cache_System.html">467 high scalability-2008-12-16-[ANN] New Open Source Cache System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The SHOP.COM Cache System is now available at http://code.google.com/p/sccache/     The SHOP.COM Cache System is an object cache system that...   * is an in-process cache and external, shared Cache   * is horizontally scalable   * stores cached objects to disk   * supports associative keys   * is non-transactional   * can have any size key and any size data   * does auto-GC based on TTL   * is container and platform neutral     It was built in-house at SHOP.COM (by me) and has powered our website for years. We are open-sourcing it in the hope that it will be useful to others and to get some help in its maintenance.     This is our first open source attempt and we'd appreciate any help and comments.</p><p>5 0.7043947 <a title="696-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Product%3A_Tugela_Cache.html">174 high scalability-2007-12-05-Product: Tugela Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tugela Cache  is a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have caching requirements that exceed their available memory.  It uses the same wire protocol as  memcached  so it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the website:   As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached, at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela, the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.  Tugela Cache is derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these changes: 
 
 Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database. 
 Expiry policy management moved to external program tugela-expire 
 Much statistics code made obsolete.

<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some the weak guarantees of Amazon's  eventual consistency  model are too cold. For many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMS  distributed transactions  are too hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right with  entity groups . Yahoo! is also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency, which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl of  rich database functionality and low latency at massive scale :
   We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database system for Yahoo!â&euro;&trade;s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency guarantees.

<p>Introduction: Infinispan  is a highly scalable, open source licensed data grid platform in the style of  GigaSpaces  and Oracle  Coherence .
 
From their website:
   The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a JSR-107 (JCACHE) compatible Cache interface (which in turn extends java.util.Map).  It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.  Offering high availability via making replicas of state across a network as well as optionally persisting state to configurable cache stores, Infinispan offers enterprise features such as efficient eviction algorithms to control memory usage as well as JTA compatibility.  In addition to the peer-to-peer architecture of Infinispan, on the roadmap is the ability to run f</p><p>3 0.93627262 <a title="696-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-07-Strategy%3A_Recompute_Instead_of_Remember_Big_Data.html">852 high scalability-2010-07-07-Strategy: Recompute Instead of Remember Big Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post  Drowning in Data , says complexity has taught him this lesson:  When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in: Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even cheaper. 
 
Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:  storage is cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data, the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing power available for a certain price .  With such data, a linear-time algorithm takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n) seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower .
 
For me it's not a matter of which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can dec</p><p>4 0.93433535 <a title="696-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_11th%2C_2013.html">1530 high scalability-2013-10-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 11th, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                                             
 
  @BrandonBloom : Mutable data structures are only faster b/c they have fewer features: ie no persistence. You must manually recover that feature w/ copying. 
  @hayesdrumwright : Scale breaks hardware Speed breaks software Scale and speed breaks everything Adrian Cockcroft - Netflix #TechSummit 
   Gladwell, Malcolm : Saul thinks of power in terms of physical might. He doesn’t appreciate that power can come in other forms as well— in breaking rules, in substituting speed and surprise for strength.
