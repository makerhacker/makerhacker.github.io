<p>Author: Vishal M. Patel, Hien Van Nguyen, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm called Latent Space Sparse Subspace Clustering for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of data lying in a union of subspaces. Specifically, we describe a method that learns the projection of data and finds the sparse coefficients in the low-dimensional latent space. Cluster labels are then assigned by applying spectral clustering to a similarity matrix built from these sparse coefficients. An efficient optimization method is proposed and its non-linear extensions based on the kernel methods are presented. One of the main advantages of our method is that it is computationally efficient as the sparse coefficients are found in the low-dimensional latent space.

<p>Author: Ali Elqursh, Ahmed Elgammal</p><p>Abstract: The vast majority of work on motion segmentation adopts the affine camera model due to its simplicity. Under the affine model, the motion segmentation problem becomes that of subspace separation. Due to this assumption, such methods are mainly offline and exhibit poor performance when the assumption is not satisfied. This is made evident in state-of-the-art methods that relax this assumption by using piecewise affine spaces and spectral clustering techniques to achieve better results. In this paper, we formulate the problem of motion segmentation as that of manifold separation. We then show how label propagation can be used in an online framework to achieve manifold separation. The performance of our framework is evaluated on a benchmark dataset and achieves competitive performance while being online.</p><p>5 0.11598473 <a title="134-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminant_Tracking_Using_Tensor_Representation_with_Semi-supervised_Improvement.html">119 iccv-2013-Discriminant Tracking Using Tensor Representation with Semi-supervised Improvement</a></p>
<p>Author: Jin Gao, Junliang Xing, Weiming Hu, Steve Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Visual tracking has witnessed growing methods in object representation, which is crucial to robust tracking. The dominant mechanism in object representation is using image features encoded in a vector as observations to perform tracking, without considering that an image is intrinsically a matrix, or a 2nd-order tensor. Thus approaches following this mechanism inevitably lose a lot of useful information, and therefore cannot fully exploit the spatial correlations within the 2D image ensembles. In this paper, we address an image as a 2nd-order tensor in its original form, and find a discriminative linear embedding space approximation to the original nonlinear submanifold embedded in the tensor space based on the graph embedding framework. We specially design two graphs for characterizing the intrinsic local geometrical structure of the tensor space, so as to retain more discriminant information when reducing the dimension along certain tensor dimensions. However, spatial correlations within a tensor are not limited to the elements along these dimensions. This means that some part of the discriminant information may not be encoded in the embedding space. We introduce a novel technique called semi-supervised improvement to iteratively adjust the embedding space to compensate for the loss of discriminant information, hence improving the performance of our tracker. Experimental results on challenging videos demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.</p><p>6 0.10309768 <a title="134-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Robust_Subspace_Clustering_via_Half-Quadratic_Minimization.html">360 iccv-2013-Robust Subspace Clustering via Half-Quadratic Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Yingya Zhang, Zhenan Sun, Ran He, Tieniu Tan</p><p>Abstract: Subspace clustering has important and wide applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. It is a challenging task to learn low-dimensional subspace structures due to the possible errors (e.g., noise and corruptions) existing in high-dimensional data. Recent subspace clustering methods usually assume a sparse representation of corrupted errors and correct the errors iteratively. However large corruptions in real-world applications can not be well addressed by these methods. A novel optimization model for robust subspace clustering is proposed in this paper. The objective function of our model mainly includes two parts. The first part aims to achieve a sparse representation of each high-dimensional data point with other data points. The second part aims to maximize the correntropy between a given data point and its low-dimensional representation with other points. Correntropy is a robust measure so that the influence of large corruptions on subspace clustering can be greatly suppressed. An extension of our method with explicit introduction of representation error terms into the model is also proposed. Half-quadratic minimization is provided as an efficient solution to the proposed robust subspace clustering formulations. Experimental results on Hopkins 155 dataset and Extended Yale Database B demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.</p><p>4 0.66721088 <a title="134-lsi-4" href="./iccv-2013-Correlation_Adaptive_Subspace_Segmentation_by_Trace_Lasso.html">93 iccv-2013-Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation by Trace Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Canyi Lu, Jiashi Feng, Zhouchen Lin, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the subspace segmentation problem. Given a set of data points drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into their underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method is used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close to block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs from the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the grouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity matrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points from different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected data which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), by using ?1-minimization, encourages sparsity for data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary, Low-RankRepresentation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares Regression (LSR), by ?2-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect, but they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is usually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR. In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation (CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method which simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated data together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and LSR. Both theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of CASS.</p><p>5 0.64462489 <a title="134-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Perspective_Motion_Segmentation_via_Collaborative_Clustering.html">314 iccv-2013-Perspective Motion Segmentation via Collaborative Clustering</a></p>

We demonstrate the performance of our SGC method on a variety of segmentation problems including planar seg- mentation of Kinect depth maps and motion segmentation of the Hopkins 155 dataset for which we achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>2 0.60063893 <a title="134-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Real-Time_Body_Tracking_with_One_Depth_Camera_and_Inertial_Sensors.html">341 iccv-2013-Real-Time Body Tracking with One Depth Camera and Inertial Sensors</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Helten, Meinard Müller, Hans-Peter Seidel, Christian Theobalt</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, the availability of inexpensive depth cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, has boosted the research in monocular full body skeletal pose tracking. Unfortunately, existing trackers often fail to capture poses where a single camera provides insufficient data, such as non-frontal poses, and all other poses with body part occlusions. In this paper, we present a novel sensor fusion approach for real-time full body tracking that succeeds in such difficult situations. It takes inspiration from previous tracking solutions, and combines a generative tracker and a discriminative tracker retrieving closest poses in a database. In contrast to previous work, both trackers employ data from a low number of inexpensive body-worn inertial sensors. These sensors provide reliable and complementary information when the monocular depth information alone is not sufficient. We also contribute by new algorithmic solutions to best fuse depth and inertial data in both trackers. One is a new visibility model to determine global body pose, occlusions and usable depth correspondences and to decide what data modality to use for discriminative tracking. We also contribute with a new inertial-basedpose retrieval, and an adapted late fusion step to calculate the final body pose.</p><p>3 0.56686431 <a title="134-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Saliency_and_Human_Fixations%3A_State-of-the-Art_and_Study_of_Comparison_Metrics.html">373 iccv-2013-Saliency and Human Fixations: State-of-the-Art and Study of Comparison Metrics</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolas Riche, Matthieu Duvinage, Matei Mancas, Bernard Gosselin, Thierry Dutoit</p><p>Abstract: Visual saliency has been an increasingly active research area in the last ten years with dozens of saliency models recently published. Nowadays, one of the big challenges in the field is to find a way to fairly evaluate all of these models. In this paper, on human eye fixations ,we compare the ranking of 12 state-of-the art saliency models using 12 similarity metrics. The comparison is done on Jian Li ’s database containing several hundreds of natural images. Based on Kendall concordance coefficient, it is shown that some of the metrics are strongly correlated leading to a redundancy in the performance metrics reported in the available benchmarks. On the other hand, other metrics provide a more diverse picture of models ’ overall performance. As a recommendation, three similarity metrics should be used to obtain a complete point of view of saliency model performance.</p><p>4 0.56230903 <a title="134-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Multi-view_Object_Segmentation_in_Space_and_Time.html">282 iccv-2013-Multi-view Object Segmentation in Space and Time</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdelaziz Djelouah, Jean-Sébastien Franco, Edmond Boyer, François Le_Clerc, Patrick Pérez</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of object segmentation in multiple views or videos when two or more viewpoints of the same scene are available. We propose a new approach that propagates segmentation coherence information in both space and time, hence allowing evidences in one image to be shared over the complete set. To this aim the segmentation is cast as a single efficient labeling problem over space and time with graph cuts. In contrast to most existing multi-view segmentation methods that rely on some form of dense reconstruction, ours only requires a sparse 3D sampling to propagate information between viewpoints. The approach is thoroughly evaluated on standard multiview datasets, as well as on videos. With static views, results compete with state of the art methods but they are achieved with significantly fewer viewpoints. With multiple videos, we report results that demonstrate the benefit of segmentation propagation through temporal cues.</p><p>5 0.52339482 <a title="134-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Measuring_Flow_Complexity_in_Videos.html">263 iccv-2013-Measuring Flow Complexity in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Saad Ali</p><p>Abstract: In this paper a notion of flow complexity that measures the amount of interaction among objects is introduced and an approach to compute it directly from a video sequence is proposed. The approach employs particle trajectories as the input representation of motion and maps it into a ‘braid’ based representation. The mapping is based on the observation that 2D trajectories of particles take the form of a braid in space-time due to the intermingling among particles over time. As a result of this mapping, the problem of estimating the flow complexity from particle trajectories becomes the problem of estimating braid complexity, which in turn can be computed by measuring the topological entropy of a braid. For this purpose recently developed mathematical tools from braid theory are employed which allow rapid computation of topological entropy of braids. The approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of open source videos depicting variations in terms of types of moving objects, scene layout, camera view angle, motion patterns, and object densities. The results show that the proposed approach is able to quantify the complexity of the flow, and at the same time provides useful insights about the sources of the complexity.</p><p>6 0.52266872 <a title="134-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Motion_for_Every_Visible_Point.html">441 iccv-2013-Video Motion for Every Visible Point</a></p>
