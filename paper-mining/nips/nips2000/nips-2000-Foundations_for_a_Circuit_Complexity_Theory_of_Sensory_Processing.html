</p><p>3 We exhibit new circuit design strategies for these new benchmark functions that can be implemented within realistic complexity bounds, in particular with linear or almost linear total wire length. [sent-7, score-1.338]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Circuit complexity theory is a classical area of theoretical computer science, that provides estimates for the complexity of circuits for computing specific benchmark functions, such as binary addition, multiplication and sorting (see, e. [sent-8, score-0.631]
</p><p>5 In recent years interest has grown in understanding the complexity of circuits for early sensory processing, both from the biological point of view and from the point of view of neuromorphic engineering (see (Mead, 1989». [sent-11, score-0.656]
</p><p>6 We will follow traditional circuit complexity theory in assuming that the underlying graph of each circuit is a directed graph without cycles. [sent-14, score-0.773]
</p><p>7 I Neural circuits in "wetware" as well as most circuits in analog VLSI contain in addition to feedforward connections also lateral and recurrent connections. [sent-16, score-0.678]
</p><p>8 The standard mathematical approach is to model such circuits by larger feedforward circuits, where new "virtual gates" are introduced to represent the state of existing gates at later points in time. [sent-18, score-0.548]
</p><p>9 The latter is defined as the length of the longest directed path in the underlying graph, and is also interpreted as the computation time of the circuit. [sent-20, score-0.134]
</p><p>10 The focus lies in general on the classification of functions that can be computed by circuits whose number of gates can be bounded by a polynomial in the number n of input variables. [sent-21, score-0.626]
</p><p>11 We proceed on the assumption that the area (or volume in the case of neural circuits) occupied by wires is a severe bottleneck for physical implementations of circuits for sensory processing. [sent-23, score-0.761]
</p><p>12 Therefore we wiJI not just count wires, but consider a complexity measure that provides an estimate for the total area or volume occupied by wires. [sent-24, score-0.342]
</p><p>13 In the cortex, neurons occupy an about 2 mm thick 3-dimensional sheet of "grey matter". [sent-25, score-0.238]
</p><p>14 n mm for the wire length of the "average" cortical circuit involving n neurons. [sent-28, score-1.283]
</p><p>15 In order to arrive at a concise mathematical model we project each 3D cortical circuit into 2D, and assume for simplicity that its n gates (neurons) occupy the nodes of a grid. [sent-29, score-0.676]
</p><p>16 Then for a circuit with n gates, the total length of the horizontal components of all wires is on average ~ 80 . [sent-30, score-0.806]
</p><p>17 Here, one grid unit is the distance between adjacent nodes on the grid, which amounts to 1O- 5 / 2 mm for an assumed density of 10 5 neurons per mm 2 of cortical surface. [sent-34, score-0.662]
</p><p>18 More abstractly, we define the following model: Gates, input- and output-ports of a circuit are placed on different nodes of a 2-dimensional grid (with unit distance 1 between adjacent nodes). [sent-37, score-0.578]
</p><p>19 These nodes can be connected by (unidirectional) wires that run through the plane in any way that the designer wants, in particular wires may cross and need not run rectilinearly (wires are thought of as running in the 3 dimensional . [sent-38, score-0.5]
</p><p>20 Ipace above the plane, without charge for vertical wire segmentsp. [sent-39, score-0.61]
</p><p>21 We refer to the minimal value of the sum of all wire lengths that can be achieved by any such arrangement as the total wire length of the circuit. [sent-40, score-1.525]
</p><p>22 The attractiveness of this model lies in its mathematical simplicity, and in its generality. [sent-41, score-0.053]
</p><p>23 There exist quite reliable estimates for the order of magnitudes for the number n of inputs, the number of neurons and the total wire length of biological neural circuits for sensory processing, see (Abeles, 1998; Koch, 1999; Shepherd, 1998; Braitenberg and Schiiz, 1998). [sent-43, score-1.478]
</p><p>24 3 2We will allow that a wire from a gate may branch and provide input to several other gates. [sent-44, score-0.661]
</p><p>25 For reasonable bounds on the maximal fan-out (10 4 in the case of neural circuits) this is realistic both for neural circuits and for VLSI. [sent-45, score-0.421]
</p><p>26 Since most asymptotic bounds in circuit complexity theory have constant factors in front that are much larger than 1, one really has to focus on circuit architectures with clearly subquadratic bounds for the total wire length. [sent-47, score-1.677]
</p><p>27 The complexity bounds for circuits that can realistically be implemented in VLSI are typically even more severe than for "wetware", and linear or almost linear bounds for the total wire length are desirable for that purpose. [sent-48, score-1.451]
</p><p>28 In this article we begin the investigation of algorithms for basic pattern recognition tasks that can be implemented within this low-level complexity regime. [sent-49, score-0.184]
</p><p>29 2 Global Pattern Detection in 2-Dimensional Maps For many important sensory processing tasks - such as for visual or somatosensory input - the input variables are arranged in a 2-dimensional map whose structure reflects spatial relationship in the outside world. [sent-52, score-0.373]
</p><p>30 We assume that local feature detectors are able to detect the presence of salient local features in their specific "receptive field", such as for example a center which emits is estimated to be around 10 6 (all estimates given are for primates, and they only reflect the order of magnitude). [sent-53, score-0.216]
</p><p>31 The total number of neurons that transmit sensory (mostly somatosensory) information to the cortex is estimated to be around 10 8 . [sent-54, score-0.424]
</p><p>32 In the subsequent sections we assume that these inputs represent the outputs of various local feature detectors for n locations in some 2-dimensional map. [sent-55, score-0.132]
</p><p>33 Thus, if one assumes for example that on average there are 10 different feature detectors for each location on this map, one arrives at biologically realistic estimates for n that lie between 10 5 and  10 7 . [sent-56, score-0.223]
</p><p>34 The total number of neurons in the primary visual cortex of primates is estimated to be around 10 9 , occupying an area of roughly 10 4 mm2 of cortical surface. [sent-57, score-0.514]
</p><p>35 There are up to 10 5 neurons under one mm2 of cortical surface, which yields a value of 10- 5 / 2 mm for the distance between adjacent grid points in our model. [sent-58, score-0.483]
</p><p>36 The total length of axonal and dendritic branches below one mm 2 of cortical surface is estimated to be between 1 and 10 km, yielding up to lOll mm total wire length for primary visual cortex. [sent-59, score-1.621]
</p><p>37 Thus if one assumes that 100 separate circuits are implemented in primary visual cortex, each of them can use 10 7 neurons and a total wire length of 10 9 mm. [sent-60, score-1.356]
</p><p>38 Hence realistic bounds for the complexity of a single one of these circuits for visual pattern recognition are 107 = n 7 / 5 neurons (for n = 105 ), and a total wire length of at most 10 1 1. [sent-61, score-1.563]
</p><p>39 The whole cortex receives sensory input from about 108 neurons. [sent-64, score-0.248]
</p><p>40 It processes this input with about 10 10 neurons and less than 10 12 mm total wire length. [sent-65, score-1.007]
</p><p>41 The actual resources available for sensory processing are likely to be substantially smaller, since most cortical neurons and circuits are believed to have many other functions besides online sensory processing. [sent-68, score-0.809]

</p><p>43 The ultimate computational goal is to detect specific global spatial arrangements of such local patterns, such as the letter "T", or in the end also a human face, in a translation- and scale-invariant manner. [sent-70, score-0.142]

</p><p>49 The depth of the circuit can be reduced to o (log n) if one employs threshold gates 6 with fan-in logn. [sent-85, score-0.59]

</p><p>68 In the remaining part of the proof sketch, we present an efficient layout for a circuit that implements this recursive algorithm. [sent-152, score-0.42]
</p><p>69 We need a layout strategy that is compatible with the recursive two-dimensional division of the input plane. [sent-153, score-0.139]
</p><p>70 We adopt for this purpose a well known design strategy: the H-tree (see (Mead and Rem, 1979». [sent-154, score-0.064]

</p><p>92 For that purpose we have introduced the total wire length as an abstract complexity measure that appears to be among the most salient ones in this context, and which can in principle be applied both to neural circuits in the cortex and to artificial circuitry. [sent-218, score-1.46]

The neuron adapts its firing rate over long time periods on the order of seconds or minutes so that it returns to its spontaneous firing rate after a lasting perturbation. Homeostasis is implemented via two schemes. One scheme looks at the presynaptic activity and adapts the synaptic weight depending on the presynaptic spiking rate.

<p>Author: Susanne Still, Bernhard Schölkopf, Klaus Hepp, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: To control the walking gaits of a four-legged robot we present a novel neuromorphic VLSI chip that coordinates the relative phasing of the robot's legs similar to how spinal Central Pattern Generators are believed to control vertebrate locomotion [3]. The chip controls the leg movements by driving motors with time varying voltages which are the outputs of a small network of coupled oscillators. The characteristics of the chip's output voltages depend on a set of input parameters. The relationship between input parameters and output voltages can be computed analytically for an idealized system. In practice, however, this ideal relationship is only approximately true due to transistor mismatch and offsets. Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning algorithm introduced recently [7]. The learning requires only that the description of the desired output is given.

<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping</p><p>Abstract: 'Kernel' principal component analysis (PCA) is an elegant nonlinear generalisation of the popular linear data analysis method, where a kernel function implicitly defines a nonlinear transformation into a feature space wherein standard PCA is performed. Unfortunately, the technique is not 'sparse', since the components thus obtained are expressed in terms of kernels associated with every training vector. This paper shows that by approximating the covariance matrix in feature space by a reduced number of example vectors, using a maximum-likelihood approach, we may obtain a highly sparse form of kernel PCA without loss of effectiveness. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.99609667 <a title="56-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Foundations_for_a_Circuit_Complexity_Theory_of_Sensory_Processing.html">56 nips-2000-Foundations for a Circuit Complexity Theory of Sensory Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Te-Won Lee, Thomas Wachtler, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by the three types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This color opponency has been shown to constitute an efficient encoding by spectral decorrelation of the receptor signals. We analyze the spatial and chromatic structure of natural scenes by decomposing the spectral images into a set of linear basis functions such that they constitute a representation with minimal redundancy. Independent component analysis finds the basis functions that transforms the spatiochromatic data such that the outputs (activations) are statistically as independent as possible, i.e. least redundant. The resulting basis functions show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges), along a blueyellow direction, and along a red-blue direction. Furthermore, the resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that the use of color opponency in the human visual system achieves a highly efficient representation of colors. Our findings suggest that color opponency is a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the overlapping cone spectral sensitivities. 1 Statistical structure of natural scenes Efficient encoding of visual sensory information is an important task for information processing systems and its study may provide insights into coding principles of biological visual systems.
