<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane

<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>4 0.081307858 <a title="125-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-24-Mass_Customized_Medicine_in_the_Future%3F.html">314 hunch net-2008-08-24-Mass Customized Medicine in the Future?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.Right now, a
new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or
not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization. The outcome is
observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better
than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a
standard treatment.Generalizing this, a filterFsorts people into two groups:
those for treatmentAand those not for treatmentBbased upon observationsx. To
measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of
groupAand measure the relative performance of the treatment.A problem often
arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated
group. A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad? With respect
to the filterFit may mean that, but with respect to another filterF', the
treatment might be very effective. For example, a drug might work great for
people wh</p><p>5 0.077701502 <a title="125-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for
all sorts of tasks where it either wasn't previously collected, or for tasks
that did not previously exist. While this is great for Machine Learning, it
has a downside--the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead
to substantial privacy problems.It's important to understand that this is a
much harder problem than many people appreciate. TheAOLdatareleaseis a good
example. To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be
obvious:Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable
information. The logic here seems to be "if I can't easily find the person
then no one can". That doesn't work as demonstrated by the people who were
found circumstantially from the AOL data.… then just hash all the search
terms! The logic here is "if I can't read it, then no one can". It's also
trivially broken by a dictionary attack--just hash all the strings that might
be in the data an</p><p>6 0.071085118 <a title="125-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-24-David_Waltz.html">460 hunch net-2012-03-24-David Waltz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic
queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com
using Internet Explorer with the Bing toolbar and later noticed some synthetic
responses from B</p><p>3 0.61487269 <a title="125-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-08-Big_machine_learning.html">178 hunch net-2006-05-08-Big machine learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to theNew York Times,Yahoo is releasing Project Panama shortly.
Project Panama is about better predicting which advertisements are relevant to
a search, implying a higher click through rate, implying larger income
forYahoo. There are two things that seem interesting here:A significant
portion of that improved accuracy is almost certainly machine learning at
work.The quantitative effect is huge--the estimate in the article is
$600*106.Googlealready has such improvements andMicrosoft Searchis surely
working on them, which suggest this is (perhaps) a $109per year machine
learning problem.The exact methodology under use is unlikely to be publicly
discussed in the near future because of the competitive enivironment.
Hopefully we'll have some public "war stories" at some point in the future
when this information becomes less sensitive. For now, it's reassuring to
simply note that machine learning is having a big impact.</p><p>4 0.60981572 <a title="125-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-25-The_Privacy_Problem.html">260 hunch net-2007-08-25-The Privacy Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Centmailis a scheme which makes charity donations have a secondary value, as a
stamp for email. When discussed onnewscientist,slashdot, and others, some of
the comments make the academic review process appear thoughtful. Some
prominent fallacies are:Costing money fallacy. Some commenters appear to
believe the system charges money per email. Instead, the basic idea is that
users get an extra benefit from donations to a charity and participation is
strictly voluntary. The solution to this fallacy is simply readingthe
details.Single solution fallacy. Some commenters seem to think this is
proposed as a complete solution to spam, and since not everyone will opt to
participate, it won't work. But a complete solution is not at all necessary or
even possible given theflag-day problem. Deployed machine learning systems for
fighting spam are great at taking advantage of a partial solution. The
solution to this fallacy is learning about machine learning. In the current
state of affairs, informed</p><p>3 0.38526833 <a title="125-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-02-Retrospective.html">225 hunch net-2007-01-02-Retrospective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique

<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of
reviewing where almost no one is happy. A basic question is: Should most
people be happy?The case against is straightforward. Anyone who watches the
flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.
By it's nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless,
and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit. If you
think about this for a moment, it's very different from most other human
endeavors. The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager,
conductor, quarterback, etcâ&euro;Ś all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even
a vaguely predictive sense of what's important in the longer term, then most
people submitting papers will be unhappy.But this argument unravels, in my
experience. Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a
small part being simply malicious. And yet, I'm sure that most reviewers
genuinely believe th</p><p>5 0.25637743 <a title="125-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-10-A_Deep_Belief_Net_Learning_Problem.html">227 hunch net-2007-01-10-A Deep Belief Net Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far
