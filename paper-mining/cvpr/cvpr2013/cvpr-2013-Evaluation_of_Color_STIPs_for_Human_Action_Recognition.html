<p>Author: Lu Xia, J.K.

In this paper, we propose its counterpart in depth video and show its efficacy on activity recognition. We present a filtering method to extract STIPsfrom depth videos (calledDSTIP) that effectively suppress the noisy measurements. Further, we build a novel depth cuboid similarity feature (DCSF) to describe the local 3D depth cuboid around the DSTIPs with an adaptable supporting size. We test this feature on activity recognition application using the public MSRAction3D, MSRDailyActivity3D datasets and our own dataset. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms stateof-the-art activity recognition algorithms on depth videos, and the framework is more widely applicable than existing approaches.

<p>Author: Rahat Khan, Joost van_de_Weijer, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Damien Muselet, Christophe Ducottet, Cecile Barat</p><p>Abstract: Color description is a challenging task because of large variations in RGB values which occur due to scene accidental events, such as shadows, shading, specularities, illuminant color changes, and changes in viewing geometry. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed by capturing the variations in physics-basedmodels, and deriving invariants for the undesired variations. The drawback of this approach is that sets of distinguishable colors in the original color space are mapped to the same value in the photometric invariant space. This results in a drop of discriminative power of the color description. In this paper we take an information theoretic approach to color description. We cluster color values together based on their discriminative power in a classification problem. The clustering has the explicit objective to minimize the drop of mutual information of the final representation. We show that such a color description automatically learns a certain degree of photometric invariance. We also show that a universal color representation, which is based on other data sets than the one at hand, can obtain competing performance. Experiments show that the proposed descriptor outperforms existing photometric invariants. Furthermore, we show that combined with shape description these color descriptors obtain excellent results on four challenging datasets, namely, PASCAL VOC 2007, Flowers-102, Stanford dogs-120 and Birds-200.</p><p>4 0.12763759 <a title="149-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Complex_Event_Detection_via_Multi-source_Video_Attributes.html">85 cvpr-2013-Complex Event Detection via Multi-source Video Attributes</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhigang Ma, Yi Yang, Zhongwen Xu, Shuicheng Yan, Nicu Sebe, Alexander G. Hauptmann</p><p>Abstract: Complex events essentially include human, scenes, objects and actions that can be summarized by visual attributes, so leveraging relevant attributes properly could be helpful for event detection. Many works have exploited attributes at image level for various applications. However, attributes at image level are possibly insufficient for complex event detection in videos due to their limited capability in characterizing the dynamic properties of video data. Hence, we propose to leverage attributes at video level (named as video attributes in this work), i.e., the semantic labels of external videos are used as attributes. Compared to complex event videos, these external videos contain simple contents such as objects, scenes and actions which are the basic elements of complex events. Specifically, building upon a correlation vector which correlates the attributes and the complex event, we incorporate video attributes latently as extra informative cues into the event detector learnt from complex event videos. Extensive experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.114312 <a title="149-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Sampling_Strategies_for_Real-Time_Action_Recognition.html">378 cvpr-2013-Sampling Strategies for Real-Time Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Shi, Emil Petriu, Robert Laganière</p><p>Abstract: Local spatio-temporal features and bag-of-features representations have become popular for action recognition. A recent trend is to use dense sampling for better performance. While many methods claimed to use dense feature sets, most of them are just denser than approaches based on sparse interest point detectors. In this paper, we explore sampling with high density on action recognition. We also investigate the impact of random sampling over dense grid for computational efficiency. We present a real-time action recognition system which integrates fast random sampling method with local spatio-temporal features extracted from a Local Part Model. A new method based on histogram intersection kernel is proposed to combine multiple channels of different descriptors. Our technique shows high accuracy on the simple KTH dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art on two very challenging real-world datasets, namely, 93% on KTH, 83.3% on UCF50 and 47.6% on HMDB51.</p><p>6 0.11042551 <a title="149-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Hollywood_3D%3A_Recognizing_Actions_in_3D_Natural_Scenes.html">205 cvpr-2013-Hollywood 3D: Recognizing Actions in 3D Natural Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Chunfeng Yuan, Xi Li, Weiming Hu, Haibin Ling, Stephen Maybank</p><p>Abstract: Spatio-temporal interest points serve as an elementary building block in many modern action recognition algorithms, and most of them exploit the local spatio-temporal volume features using a Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) representation. Such representation, however, ignorespotentially valuable information about the global spatio-temporal distribution of interest points. In this paper, we propose a new global feature to capture the detailed geometrical distribution of interest points. It is calculated by using the ℛ transform which is defined as an extended 3D discrete Rℛa tdroann transform, followed by applying a tewdo 3-dDir decitsicorneatel two-dimensional principal component analysis. Such ℛ feature captures the geometrical information of the Sinuctehre ℛst points and keeps invariant to geometry transformation and robust to noise. In addition, we propose a new fusion strategy to combine the ℛ feature with the BOVW representation for further improving recognition accuracy.

<p>Author: Hao Jiang, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel linear method to match cuboids in indoor scenes using RGBD images from Kinect. Beyond depth maps, these cuboids reveal important structures of a scene. Instead of directly fitting cuboids to 3D data, we first construct cuboid candidates using superpixel pairs on a RGBD image, and then we optimize the configuration of the cuboids to satisfy the global structure constraints. The optimal configuration has low local matching costs, small object intersection and occlusion, and the cuboids tend to project to a large region in the image; the number of cuboids is optimized simultaneously. We formulate the multiple cuboid matching problem as a mixed integer linear program and solve the optimization efficiently with a branch and bound method. The optimization guarantees the global optimal solution. Our experiments on the Kinect RGBD images of a variety of indoor scenes show that our proposed method is efficient, accurate and robust against object appearance variations, occlusions and strong clutter.</p><p>5 0.62270647 <a title="149-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Motionlets%3A_Mid-level_3D_Parts_for_Human_Motion_Recognition.html">291 cvpr-2013-Motionlets: Mid-level 3D Parts for Human Motion Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: LiMin Wang, Yu Qiao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes motionlet, a mid-level and spatiotemporal part, for human motion recognition. Motionlet can be seen as a tight cluster in motion and appearance space, corresponding to the moving process of different body parts. We postulate three key properties of motionlet for action recognition: high motion saliency, multiple scale representation, and representative-discriminative ability. Towards this goal, we develop a data-driven approach to learn motionlets from training videos. First, we extract 3D regions with high motion saliency. Then we cluster these regions and preserve the centers as candidate templates for motionlet. Finally, we examine the representative and discriminative power of the candidates, and introduce a greedy method to select effective candidates. With motionlets, we present a mid-level representation for video, called motionlet activation vector. We conduct experiments on three datasets, KTH, HMDB51, and UCF50. The results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>6 0.61467665 <a title="149-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Spatiotemporal_Deformable_Part_Models_for_Action_Detection.html">408 cvpr-2013-Spatiotemporal Deformable Part Models for Action Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Fragoso, Matthew Turk</p><p>Abstract: We present SWIGS, a Swift and efficient Guided Sampling method for robust model estimation from image feature correspondences. Our method leverages the accuracy of our new confidence measure (MR-Rayleigh), which assigns a correctness-confidence to a putative correspondence in an online fashion. MR-Rayleigh is inspired by Meta-Recognition (MR), an algorithm that aims to predict when a classifier’s outcome is correct. We demonstrate that by using a Rayleigh distribution, the prediction accuracy of MR can be improved considerably. Our experiments show that MR-Rayleigh tends to predict better than the often-used Lowe ’s ratio, Brown’s ratio, and the standard MR under a range of imaging conditions. Furthermore, our homography estimation experiment demonstrates that SWIGS performs similarly or better than other guided sampling methods while requiring fewer iterations, leading to fast and accurate model estimates.</p><p>2 0.88127762 <a title="149-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Multipath_Sparse_Coding_Using_Hierarchical_Matching_Pursuit.html">304 cvpr-2013-Multipath Sparse Coding Using Hierarchical Matching Pursuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: Complex real-world signals, such as images, contain discriminative structures that differ in many aspects including scale, invariance, and data channel. While progress in deep learning shows the importance of learning features through multiple layers, it is equally important to learn features through multiple paths. We propose Multipath Hierarchical Matching Pursuit (M-HMP), a novel feature learning architecture that combines a collection of hierarchical sparse features for image classification to capture multiple aspects of discriminative structures. Our building blocks are MI-KSVD, a codebook learning algorithm that balances the reconstruction error and the mutual incoherence of the codebook, and batch orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP); we apply them recursively at varying layers and scales. The result is a highly discriminative image representation that leads to large improvements to the state-of-the-art on many standard benchmarks, e.g., Caltech-101, Caltech-256, MITScenes, Oxford-IIIT Pet and Caltech-UCSD Bird-200.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.86714435 <a title="149-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Evaluation_of_Color_STIPs_for_Human_Action_Recognition.html">149 cvpr-2013-Evaluation of Color STIPs for Human Action Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivo Everts, Jan C. van_Gemert, Theo Gevers</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with recognizing realistic human actions in videos based on spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs). Existing STIP-based action recognition approaches operate on intensity representations of the image data. Because of this, these approaches are sensitive to disturbing photometric phenomena such as highlights and shadows. Moreover, valuable information is neglected by discarding chromaticity from the photometric representation. These issues are addressed by Color STIPs. Color STIPs are multi-channel reformulations of existing intensity-based STIP detectors and descriptors, for which we consider a number of chromatic representations derived from the opponent color space. This enhanced modeling of appearance improves the quality of subsequent STIP detection and description. Color STIPs are shown to substantially outperform their intensity-based counterparts on the challenging UCF sports, UCF11 and UCF50 action recognition benchmarks. Moreover, the results show that color STIPs are currently the single best low-level feature choice for STIP-based approaches to human action recognition.</p><p>4 0.86674356 <a title="149-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Minimum_Uncertainty_Gap_for_Robust_Visual_Tracking.html">285 cvpr-2013-Minimum Uncertainty Gap for Robust Visual Tracking</a></p>
<p>Author: Junseok Kwon, Kyoung Mu Lee</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel tracking algorithm that robustly tracks the target by finding the state which minimizes uncertainty of the likelihood at current state. The uncertainty of the likelihood is estimated by obtaining the gap between the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood. By minimizing the gap between the two bounds, our method finds the confident and reliable state of the target. In the paper, the state that gives the Minimum Uncertainty Gap (MUG) between likelihood bounds is shown to be more reliable than the state which gives the maximum likelihood only, especially when there are severe illumination changes, occlusions, and pose variations. A rigorous derivation of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood for the visual tracking problem is provided to address this issue. Additionally, an efficient inference algorithm using Interacting Markov Chain Monte Carlo is presented to find the best state that maximizes the average of the lower and upper bounds of the likelihood and minimizes the gap between two bounds simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully tracks the target in realistic videos and outperforms conventional tracking methods.</p><p>5 0.8661741 <a title="149-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Finding_Group_Interactions_in_Social_Clutter.html">172 cvpr-2013-Finding Group Interactions in Social Clutter</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruonan Li, Parker Porfilio, Todd Zickler</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of finding distinctive social interactions involving groups of agents embedded in larger social gatherings. Given a pre-defined gallery of short exemplar interaction videos, and a long input video of a large gathering (with approximately-tracked agents), we identify within the gathering small sub-groups of agents exhibiting social interactions that resemble those in the exemplars. The participants of each detected group interaction are localized in space; the extent of their interaction is localized in time; and when the gallery ofexemplars is annotated with group-interaction categories, each detected interaction is classified into one of the pre-defined categories. Our approach represents group behaviors by dichotomous collections of descriptors for (a) individual actions, and (b) pairwise interactions; and it includes efficient algorithms for optimally distinguishing participants from by-standers in every temporal unit and for temporally localizing the extent of the group interaction. Most importantly, the method is generic and can be applied whenever numerous interacting agents can be approximately tracked over time. We evaluate the approach using three different video collections, two that involve humans and one that involves mice.</p><p>6 0.86607963 <a title="149-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Exploring_Compositional_High_Order_Pattern_Potentials_for_Structured_Output_Learning.html">156 cvpr-2013-Exploring Compositional High Order Pattern Potentials for Structured Output Learning</a></p>
