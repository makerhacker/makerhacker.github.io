<p>Author: Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: Most previous graph-based parsing models increase decoding complexity when they use high-order features due to exact-inference decoding. In this paper, we present an approach to enriching high-orderfeature representations for graph-based dependency parsing models using a dependency language model and beam search. The dependency language model is built on a large-amount of additional autoparsed data that is processed by a baseline parser. Based on the dependency language model, we represent a set of features for the parsing model. Finally, the features are efficiently integrated into the parsing model during decoding using beam search. Our approach has two advantages. Firstly we utilize rich high-order features defined over a view of large scope and additional large raw corpus. Secondly our approach does not increase the decoding complexity. We evaluate the proposed approach on English and Chinese data. The experimental results show that our new parser achieves the best accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data.</p><p>3 0.14619645 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2012-A_Comparison_of_Chinese_Parsers_for_Stanford_Dependencies.html">5 acl-2012-A Comparison of Chinese Parsers for Stanford Dependencies</a></p>
<p>Author: Wanxiang Che ; Valentin Spitkovsky ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Stanford dependencies are widely used in natural language processing as a semanticallyoriented representation, commonly generated either by (i) converting the output of a constituent parser, or (ii) predicting dependencies directly. Previous comparisons of the two approaches for English suggest that starting from constituents yields higher accuracies. In this paper, we re-evaluate both methods for Chinese, using more accurate dependency parsers than in previous work. Our comparison of performance and efficiency across seven popular open source parsers (four constituent and three dependency) shows, by contrast, that recent higher-order graph-based techniques can be more accurate, though somewhat slower, than constituent parsers. We demonstrate also that n-way jackknifing is a useful technique for producing automatic (rather than gold) partof-speech tags to train Chinese dependency parsers. Finally, we analyze the relations produced by both kinds of parsing and suggest which specific parsers to use in practice.</p><p>4 0.14015248 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2012-Crosslingual_Induction_of_Semantic_Roles.html">64 acl-2012-Crosslingual Induction of Semantic Roles</a></p>
<p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Alexandre Klementiev</p><p>Abstract: We argue that multilingual parallel data provides a valuable source of indirect supervision for induction of shallow semantic representations. Specifically, we consider unsupervised induction of semantic roles from sentences annotated with automatically-predicted syntactic dependency representations and use a stateof-the-art generative Bayesian non-parametric model. At inference time, instead of only seeking the model which explains the monolingual data available for each language, we regularize the objective by introducing a soft constraint penalizing for disagreement in argument labeling on aligned sentences. We propose a simple approximate learning algorithm for our set-up which results in efficient inference. When applied to German-English parallel data, our method obtains a substantial improvement over a model trained without using the agreement signal, when both are tested on non-parallel sentences.</p><p>5 0.13776992 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2012-A_Comparative_Study_of_Target_Dependency_Structures_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">4 acl-2012-A Comparative Study of Target Dependency Structures for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xianchao Wu ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Kevin Duh ; Hajime Tsukada ; Masaaki Nagata</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of target dependency structures yielded by several state-of-the-art linguistic parsers. Our approach is to measure the impact of these nonisomorphic dependency structures to be used for string-to-dependency translation. Besides using traditional dependency parsers, we also use the dependency structures transformed from PCFG trees and predicate-argument structures (PASs) which are generated by an HPSG parser and a CCG parser. The experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show that the HPSG parser’s PASs achieved the best dependency and translation accuracies. 1</p><p>6 0.13604665 <a title="172-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2012-Higher-order_Constituent_Parsing_and_Parser_Combination.html">109 acl-2012-Higher-order Constituent Parsing and Parser Combination</a></p>

<p>Author: Emily Pitler</p><p>Abstract: Prepositions and conjunctions are two of the largest remaining bottlenecks in parsing. Across various existing parsers, these two categories have the lowest accuracies, and mistakes made have consequences for downstream applications. Prepositions and conjunctions are often assumed to depend on lexical dependencies for correct resolution. As lexical statistics based on the training set only are sparse, unlabeled data can help ameliorate this sparsity problem. By including unlabeled data features into a factorization of the problem which matches the representation of prepositions and conjunctions, we achieve a new state-of-the-art for English dependencies with 93.55% correct attachments on the current standard. Furthermore, conjunctions are attached with an accuracy of 90.8%, and prepositions with an accuracy of 87.4%.</p><p>4 0.65266651 <a title="172-lsi-4" href="./acl-2012-Semi-supervised_Dependency_Parsing_using_Lexical_Affinities.html">175 acl-2012-Semi-supervised Dependency Parsing using Lexical Affinities</a></p>
<p>Author: Seyed Abolghasem Mirroshandel ; Alexis Nasr ; Joseph Le Roux</p><p>Abstract: Treebanks are not large enough to reliably model precise lexical phenomena. This deficiency provokes attachment errors in the parsers trained on such data. We propose in this paper to compute lexical affinities, on large corpora, for specific lexico-syntactic configurations that are hard to disambiguate and introduce the new information in a parser. Experiments on the French Treebank showed a relative decrease ofthe error rate of 7. 1% Labeled Accuracy Score yielding the best parsing results on this treebank.</p><p>5 0.6426059 <a title="172-lsi-5" href="./acl-2012-Utilizing_Dependency_Language_Models_for_Graph-based_Dependency_Parsing_Models.html">213 acl-2012-Utilizing Dependency Language Models for Graph-based Dependency Parsing Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Huang ; Richard Socher ; Christopher Manning ; Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised word representations are very useful in NLP tasks both as inputs to learning algorithms and as extra word features in NLP systems. However, most of these models are built with only local context and one representation per word. This is problematic because words are often polysemous and global context can also provide useful information for learning word meanings. We present a new neural network architecture which 1) learns word embeddings that better capture the semantics of words by incorporating both local and global document context, and 2) accounts for homonymy and polysemy by learning multiple embeddings per word. We introduce a new dataset with human judgments on pairs of words in sentential context, and evaluate our model on it, showing that our model outperforms competitive baselines and other neural language models. 1</p><p>2 0.91572315 <a title="172-lda-2" href="./acl-2012-Private_Access_to_Phrase_Tables_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">164 acl-2012-Private Access to Phrase Tables for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashish Vaswani ; Liang Huang ; David Chiang</p><p>Abstract: Two decades after their invention, the IBM word-based translation models, widely available in the GIZA++ toolkit, remain the dominant approach to word alignment and an integral part of many statistical translation systems. Although many models have surpassed them in accuracy, none have supplanted them in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple extension to the IBM models: an ‘0 prior to encourage sparsity in the word-to-word translation model. We explain how to implement this extension efficiently for large-scale data (also released as a modification to GIZA++) and demonstrate, in experiments on Czech, Arabic, Chinese, and Urdu to English translation, significant improvements over IBM Model 4 in both word alignment (up to +6.7 F1) and translation quality (up to +1.4 B ).</p><p>5 0.68997145 <a title="172-lda-5" href="./acl-2012-Improving_the_IBM_Alignment_Models_Using_Variational_Bayes.html">118 acl-2012-Improving the IBM Alignment Models Using Variational Bayes</a></p>
<p>Author: Darcey Riley ; Daniel Gildea</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian approaches have been shown to reduce the amount of overfitting that occurs when running the EM algorithm, by placing prior probabilities on the model parameters. We apply one such Bayesian technique, variational Bayes, to the IBM models of word alignment for statistical machine translation. We show that using variational Bayes improves the performance of the widely used GIZA++ software, as well as improving the overall performance of the Moses machine translation system in terms of BLEU score.</p><p>6 0.66374683 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./acl-2012-Mixing_Multiple_Translation_Models_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">143 acl-2012-Mixing Multiple Translation Models in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
