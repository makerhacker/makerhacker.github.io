<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byYelp's JimBlomo. Jim manages a growing data mining team
that usesHadoop,mrjob, andoddjobto processTBsof data. Before Yelp, he built
infrastructure for startups and Amazon. Check out his upcoming talk
atOSCON2013 on Building a Cloud Culture at Yelp.In Q1 2013, Yelp had102
million unique visitors(source: Google Analytics) including approximately 10
million unique mobile devices using the Yelp app on a monthly average
basis.Yelpershavewritten more than39 million rich, local reviews, making Yelp
the leading local guide on everything from boutiques and mechanics to
restaurants and dentists. With respect to data, one of the most unique things
about Yelp is the variety of data: reviews, user profiles, business
descriptions, menus, check-ins, food photos... the list goes on.  We have many
ways to deal data, but today I'll focus on how we handle offline data
processing and analytics.In late 2009, Yelp investigated using Amazon's

<p>Introduction: Jeff Deangave a talk at SFBay ACMand at about 3 minutes in he goes over how
Google runs jobs on computers, which is different than how most shops
distribute workloads.It's common for machines to be dedicated to one service,
say run a database, run a cache, run this, or run that. The logic is:Better
control over responsiveness as you generally know the traffic loads a machine
will experience and you can over provision a box to be safe.Easier to manage,
load balance, configure, upgrade, create and make highly available. Since you
know what a machine does another machine can be provisioned to do the same
work.The problem is monocropping hardware though conceptually clean for humans
and safe for applications, is hugely wasteful. Machines are woefully
underutilized, even in a virtualized world.What Google does is use ashared
environmentin a datacenter where all kinds of stuff run on each computer.
Batch computation and interactive computations all run together on the same
machine.

<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:The Flickr
engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To
that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential
work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.Flickr uses a
queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also
does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent postQueue
everything and delight everyone. Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably
solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.The process:Identify
the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation
succeeded. It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting
a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all
the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care
when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate period
of time.Queue</p><p>6 0.038744278 <a title="326-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-30-Learn_How_to_Think_at_Scale.html">666 high scalability-2009-07-30-Learn How to Think at Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>3 0.69440305 <a title="326-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-30-Learn_How_to_Think_at_Scale.html">666 high scalability-2009-07-30-Learn How to Think at Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aaron Kimball of Cloudera gives a wonderful 23 minute presentation
titledCloudera Hadoop Training: Thinking at Scale Clouderawhich talks about
"common challenges and general best practices for scaling with your data." As
a company Cloudera offers "enterprise-level support to users of Apache
Hadoop." Part of that offering is a really useful series oftutorial videos on
the Hadoop ecosystem.Like TV lawyer Perry Mason (or is it Harmon Rabb?), Aaron
gradually builds his case. He opens with the problem of storing lots of data.
Then a blistering cross examination of the problem of building distributed
systems to analyze that data sets up a powerful closing argument. With so much
testimony behind him, on closing Aaron really brings it home with why shared
nothing systems like map-reduce are the right solution on how to query lots of
data. They jury loved it.Here's the videoThinking at Scale. And here's a

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable
applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an
alarmingly high competition crushing rate. Their goal is always to build a

<p>Introduction: From their website:Condoris a specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor
provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or
parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and
where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress,
and ultimately informs the user upon completion.While providing functionality
similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel
architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling
systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute
nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable
Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop
workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop
machines where the keyboard and mo</p><p>4 0.77760339 <a title="326-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-28-Google_Voice_Architecture.html">640 high scalability-2009-06-28-Google Voice Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:
