<p>Author: Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: A method is described which, like the kernel trick in support vector machines (SVMs), lets us generalize distance-based algorithms to operate in feature spaces, usually nonlinearly related to the input space. This is done by identifying a class of kernels which can be represented as norm-based distances in Hilbert spaces. It turns out that common kernel algorithms, such as SVMs and kernel PCA, are actually really distance based algorithms and can be run with that class of kernels, too.

<p>Author: Christopher K. I. Williams</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show that the kernel peA algorithm of Sch6lkopf et al (1998) can be interpreted as a form of metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) when the kernel function k(x, y) is isotropic, i.e. it depends only on Ilx - yll. This leads to a metric MDS algorithm where the desired configuration of points is found via the solution of an eigenproblem rather than through the iterative optimization of the stress objective function. The question of kernel choice is also discussed. 1</p><p>4 0.27193254 <a title="121-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Text_Classification_using_String_Kernels.html">130 nips-2000-Text Classification using String Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Huma Lodhi, John Shawe-Taylor, Nello Cristianini, Christopher J. C. H. Watkins</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel kernel for comparing two text documents. The kernel is an inner product in the feature space consisting of all subsequences of length k. A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results. 1</p><p>5 0.22612381 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Automatic_Choice_of_Dimensionality_for_PCA.html">27 nips-2000-Automatic Choice of Dimensionality for PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas P. Minka</p><p>Abstract: A central issue in principal component analysis (PCA) is choosing the number of principal components to be retained. By interpreting PCA as density estimation, we show how to use Bayesian model selection to estimate the true dimensionality of the data. The resulting estimate is simple to compute yet guaranteed to pick the correct dimensionality, given enough data. The estimate involves an integral over the Steifel manifold of k-frames, which is difficult to compute exactly. But after choosing an appropriate parameterization and applying Laplace's method, an accurate and practical estimator is obtained. In simulations, it is convincingly better than cross-validation and other proposed algorithms, plus it runs much faster.</p><p>6 0.22497372 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Regularization_with_Dot-Product_Kernels.html">110 nips-2000-Regularization with Dot-Product Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Sebastian Mika, Gunnar R채tsch, Klaus-Robert M체ller</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a new kernel-based classifier: the Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD). A mathematical programming formulation based on the observation that KFD maximizes the average margin permits an interesting modification of the original KFD algorithm yielding the sparse KFD. We find that both, KFD and the proposed sparse KFD, can be understood in an unifying probabilistic context. Furthermore, we show connections to Support Vector Machines and Relevance Vector Machines. From this understanding, we are able to outline an interesting kernel-regression technique based upon the KFD algorithm. Simulations support the usefulness of our approach.</p><p>3 0.97073615 <a title="121-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-New_Approaches_Towards_Robust_and_Adaptive_Speech_Recognition.html">90 nips-2000-New Approaches Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Tong, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks are graphical representations of probability distributions. In virtually all of the work on learning these networks, the assumption is that we are presented with a data set consisting of randomly generated instances from the underlying distribution. In many situations, however, we also have the option of active learning, where we have the possibility of guiding the sampling process by querying for certain types of samples. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the parameters of Bayesian networks in an active learning setting. We provide a theoretical framework for this problem, and an algorithm that chooses which active learning queries to generate based on the model learned so far. We present experimental results showing that our active learning algorithm can significantly reduce the need for training data in many situations.</p><p>5 0.90697306 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Programmable_Reinforcement_Learning_Agents.html">105 nips-2000-Programmable Reinforcement Learning Agents</a></p>
<p>Author: David Andre, Stuart J. Russell</p><p>Abstract: We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learning that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learning process.The language includes standard features such as parameterized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but also allows for unspecified choices in the agent program. For learning that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algorithms. We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the language are concise as well as modular. This facilitates state abstraction and the transferability of learned skills.</p><p>6 0.87021911 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Text_Classification_using_String_Kernels.html">130 nips-2000-Text Classification using String Kernels</a></p>
