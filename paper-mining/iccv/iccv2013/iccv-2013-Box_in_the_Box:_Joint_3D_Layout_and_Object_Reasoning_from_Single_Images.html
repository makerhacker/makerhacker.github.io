Towards this goal, we propose an effective model that is able to exploit both depth and appearance features, which are complementary. Furthermore, our approach is efficient as we exploit the inherent decomposition of additive potentials.

<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Jianxiong Xiao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generative model to describe the layouts of outdoor scenes the spatial configuration of regions. Specifically, the layout of an image is represented as a composite of regions, each associated with a semantic topic. At the heart of this model is a novel stochastic process called Spatial Topic Process, which generates a spatial map of topics from a set of coupled Gaussian processes, thus allowing the distributions of topics to vary continuously across the image plane. A key aspect that distinguishes this model from previous ones consists in its capability of capturing dependencies across both locations and topics while allowing substantial variations in the layouts. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed model by testing it on scene classification, semantic segmentation, and layout hallucination. –</p><p>4 0.33313936 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-3DNN%3A_Viewpoint_Invariant_3D_Geometry_Matching_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 iccv-2013-3DNN: Viewpoint Invariant 3D Geometry Matching for Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Satkin, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: We present a new algorithm 3DNN (3D NearestNeighbor), which is capable of matching an image with 3D data, independently of the viewpoint from which the image was captured. By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-beforeseen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.</p><p>5 0.17976797 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Holistic_Scene_Understanding_for_3D_Object_Detection_with_RGBD_Cameras.html">201 iccv-2013-Holistic Scene Understanding for 3D Object Detection with RGBD Cameras</a></p>
<p>Author: Dahua Lin, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of indoor scene understanding using RGBD data. Towards this goal, we propose a holistic approach that exploits 2D segmentation, 3D geometry, as well as contextual relations between scenes and objects. Specifically, we extend the CPMC [3] framework to 3D in order to generate candidate cuboids, and develop a conditional random field to integrate information from different sources to classify the cuboids. With this formulation, scene classification and 3D object recognition are coupled and can be jointly solved through probabilistic inference. We test the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging NYU v2 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that through effective evidence integration and holistic reasoning, our approach achieves substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.16481294 <a title="64-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Support_Surface_Prediction_in_Indoor_Scenes.html">410 iccv-2013-Support Surface Prediction in Indoor Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Ziheng Wang, Yongqiang Li, Shangfei Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of facial action unit (AU) recognition by exploiting the complex semantic relationships among AUs, which carry crucial top-down information yet have not been thoroughly exploited. Towards this goal, we build a hierarchical model that combines the bottom-level image features and the top-level AU relationships to jointly recognize AUs in a principled manner. The proposed model has two major advantages over existing methods. 1) Unlike methods that can only capture local pair-wise AU dependencies, our model is developed upon the restricted Boltzmann machine and therefore can exploit the global relationships among AUs. 2) Although AU relationships are influenced by many related factors such as facial expressions, these factors are generally ignored by the current methods. Our model, however, can successfully capture them to more accurately characterize the AU relationships. Efficient learning and inference algorithms of the proposed model are also developed. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modelling complex AU relationships as well as its superior AU recognition performance over existing approaches.</p><p>2 0.9023152 <a title="64-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Live_Metric_3D_Reconstruction_on_Mobile_Phones.html">254 iccv-2013-Live Metric 3D Reconstruction on Mobile Phones</a></p>

Specifically, we propose methods based on generating auxiliary data in the form of synthetic samples using transformations of the original sparse samples. To incorporate the auxiliary data, we propose a weighted data synthesis method, which adaptively selects from the generated samples for inclusion during the manifold learning process via a weighted iterative algorithm. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we apply it to the problem of face image synthesis from sparse samples. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method shows encouraging results with good performance improvements.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.8943063 <a title="64-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Box_in_the_Box%3A_Joint_3D_Layout_and_Object_Reasoning_from_Single_Images.html">64 iccv-2013-Box in the Box: Joint 3D Layout and Object Reasoning from Single Images</a></p>

Towards this goal, we propose a branch and bound algorithm which is guaranteed to retrieve the global optimum of the joint problem. The main difficulty resides in taking into account occlusion in order to not over-count the evidence. We introduce a new decomposition method, which generalizes integral geometry to triangular shapes, and allows us to bound the different terms in constant time. We exploit both geometric cues and object detectors as image features and show large improvements in 2D and 3D object detection over state-of-the-art deformable part-based models.</p><p>5 0.86780238 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Discriminative_Label_Propagation_for_Multi-object_Tracking_with_Sporadic_Appearance_Features.html">120 iccv-2013-Discriminative Label Propagation for Multi-object Tracking with Sporadic Appearance Features</a></p>
<p>Author: K.C. Amit Kumar, Christophe De_Vleeschouwer</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of plausible detections, detected at each time instant independently, we investigate how to associate them across time. This is done by propagating labels on a set of graphs that capture how the spatio-temporal and the appearance cues promote the assignment of identical or distinct labels to a pair of nodes. The graph construction is driven by the locally linear embedding (LLE) of either the spatio-temporal or the appearance features associated to the detections. Interestingly, the neighborhood of a node in each appearance graph is defined to include all nodes for which the appearance feature is available (except the ones that coexist at the same time). This allows to connect the nodes that share the same appearance even if they are temporally distant, which gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically along the sequence of detections. Once the graphs have been defined, the multi-object tracking is formulated as the problem of finding a label assignment that is consistent with the constraints captured by each of the graphs. This results into a difference of convex program that can be efficiently solved. Experiments are performed on a basketball and several well-known pedestrian datasets in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</p><p>6 0.86688 <a title="64-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Event_Recognition_in_Photo_Collections_with_a_Stopwatch_HMM.html">147 iccv-2013-Event Recognition in Photo Collections with a Stopwatch HMM</a></p>
