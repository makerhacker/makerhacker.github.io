<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANET’s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>3 0.17515202 <a title="118-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Propminer%3A_A_Workflow_for_Interactive_Information_Extraction_and_Exploration_using_Dependency_Trees.html">285 acl-2013-Propminer: A Workflow for Interactive Information Extraction and Exploration using Dependency Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Akbik ; Oresti Konomi ; Michail Melnikov</p><p>Abstract: The use ofdeep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction. Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this system demonstration, we present a tool and a workflow designed to enable initiate users to interactively explore the effect and expressivity of creating Information Extraction rules over dependency trees. We introduce the proposed five step workflow for creating information extractors, the graph query based rule language, as well as the core features of the PROP- MINER tool.</p><p>4 0.12832804 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-WebAnno%3A_A_Flexible%2C_Web-based_and_Visually_Supported_System_for_Distributed_Annotations.html">385 acl-2013-WebAnno: A Flexible, Web-based and Visually Supported System for Distributed Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Seid Muhie Yimam ; Iryna Gurevych ; Richard Eckart de Castilho ; Chris Biemann</p><p>Abstract: We present WebAnno, a general purpose web-based annotation tool for a wide range of linguistic annotations. WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser. It supports arbitrarily large documents, pluggable import/export filters, the curation of annotations across various users, and an interface to farming out annotations to a crowdsourcing platform. Currently WebAnno allows part-ofspeech, named entity, dependency parsing and co-reference chain annotations. The architecture design allows adding additional modes of visualization and editing, when new kinds of annotations are to be supported.</p><p>5 0.11558685 <a title="118-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_Similarity%3A_An_Open_Source_Framework_for_Text_Similarity.html">104 acl-2013-DKPro Similarity: An Open Source Framework for Text Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Bar ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present DKPro Similarity, an open source framework for text similarity. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive repository of text similarity measures which are implemented using standardized interfaces. DKPro Similarity comprises a wide variety of measures ranging from ones based on simple n-grams and common subsequences to high-dimensional vector comparisons and structural, stylistic, and phonetic measures. In order to promote the reproducibility of experimental results and to provide reliable, permanent experimental conditions for future studies, DKPro Similarity additionally comes with a set of full-featured experimental setups which can be run out-of-the-box and be used for future systems to built upon.</p><p>6 0.11360902 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_WSD%3A_A_Generalized_UIMA-based_Framework_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">105 acl-2013-DKPro WSD: A Generalized UIMA-based Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>4 0.67070943 <a title="118-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Crowdsourcing_Interaction_Logs_to_Understand_Text_Reuse_from_the_Web.html">100 acl-2013-Crowdsourcing Interaction Logs to Understand Text Reuse from the Web</a></p>

We combine (i) features on sourceside syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames.

<p>Author: Heba Elfardy ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a supervised approach for performing sentence level dialect identification between Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Dialectal Arabic. We use token level labels to derive sentence-level features. These features are then used with other core and meta features to train a generative classifier that predicts the correct label for each sentence in the given input text. The system achieves an accuracy of 85.5% on an Arabic online-commentary dataset outperforming a previously proposed approach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a significant gain over a majority baseline of 5 1.9% and two strong baseline systems of 78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.</p><p>3 0.78109092 <a title="118-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.7656554 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>5 0.76451987 <a title="118-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>6 0.75936604 <a title="118-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">40 acl-2013-Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
