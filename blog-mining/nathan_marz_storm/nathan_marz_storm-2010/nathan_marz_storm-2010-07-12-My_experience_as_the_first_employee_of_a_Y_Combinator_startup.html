<h1>19 nathan marz storm-2010-07-12-My experience as the first employee of a Y Combinator startup</h1>
<br/><h2>meta infos for this blog</h2><p>Source: <a title="nathan_marz_storm-2010-19-html" href="http://nathanmarz.com//blog/my-experience-as-the-first-employee-of-a-y-combinator-startu.html">html</a></p><p>Introduction: I'm the first employee of  BackType , a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome, but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for everyone.
 
The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship. Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity. 
  No Rules  
There are a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of the rules  are  rules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.
 
B</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Where I work   When I first started at BackType, I came into the office  1   everyday. [sent-12, score-0.463]
</p><p>2 By this point I was synced up with the codebase and product direction, so I decided to work from home one day. [sent-15, score-0.543]
</p><p>3 I didn't ask the founders for permission or anything, I just told them via instant message "I'm working from home today". [sent-16, score-0.638]
</p><p>4 It was a great decision and I started working from home more and more. [sent-18, score-0.512]
</p><p>5 I've found that if I work for 8 hours with a half-hour commute each way I'm going to feel pretty exhausted at the end of the day. [sent-19, score-0.616]
</p><p>6 But if I stay at home I can work for 12 hours and feel fine. [sent-20, score-0.775]
</p><p>7 Part of the discrepancy is that when I work from home I am able to easily pace myself. [sent-21, score-0.582]
</p><p>8 Since I work from home so frequently, I get a lot of exercise and can cook for myself. [sent-26, score-0.446]
</p><p>9 I've converged on going into the office twice a week and working from home the other days. [sent-27, score-0.598]
</p><p>10 When I work   Not surprisingly, I choose my own work hours as well. [sent-30, score-0.582]
</p><p>11 I usually work 6 days a week, forcing myself to take one day off a week to avoid burn-out. [sent-31, score-0.545]
</p><p>12 On a weekday, I generally wake up around 11:00am and work until 2am, taking breaks to eat, exercise, and hang out with my roommates for a bit. [sent-32, score-0.474]
</p><p>13 I find that I become significantly hampered by lack of sleep, more than most people, and that it's better to work less hours fully rested than more hours fatigued. [sent-35, score-0.572]
</p><p>14 What I work on   Our most important goal as a team is to maximize the rate at which we're learning about our market and customer needs. [sent-38, score-0.455]
</p><p>15 The founders provide me with specific product goals, such as new stats to serve in our product. [sent-40, score-0.467]
</p><p>16 The founders    Mike  and  Chris  work harder than I thought was possible. [sent-73, score-0.518]
</p><p>17 "    So yea, they're intense, but I wouldn't still be working with them after six months unless they were awesome to work with. [sent-76, score-0.517]
</p><p>18 The freedom of working for a startup   It's no coincidence that I've been doing lots of awesome stuff like blogging, open source, and speaking since I've joined BackType. [sent-82, score-0.639]
</p><p>19 One of those has been the  freedom to open source  internal projects I work on. [sent-85, score-0.495]
</p><p>20 Of course, the freedom of working for a startup carries with it more responsibility as well. [sent-87, score-0.471]

<p>Introduction: When I finished college, I was incredibly naive when it came to finding a great job. I knew that I wanted to work at a small startup but didn't know how to find that great opportunity. I didn't know what questions to ask to evaluate a company, and I didn't know how I should present myself during the recruitment process.
 
Now I'm a few years out of college and  I have that kick-ass job  I was looking for. My dual experiences of looking for a job and being on the other side recruiting programmers have taught me quite a bit about what it takes to get a great job at a kick-ass startup.
 
Here are my tips, from preparing for the job search process to finding great startups to applying and getting the job. If you have any tips of your own, be sure to leave them in the comments!

<p>Introduction: I was  recently interviewed  for "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being, ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on my blog. Hope you enjoy! 
  What drew you to programming and what was the first interesting program you wrote?  
I started programming when I was 10 years old on my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class :D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power.

<p>Introduction: I had a revelation the other day. I realized that the terms "programmer" and "employee" are inadequate to describe what I am. What I am is a product, and you are one too. If you want to develop your career, you need to approach your career as a product development problem.
 
You sell yourself for various things: money, status, the opportunity to work on interesting problems, good coworkers, etc. In this post I'll be referring to this as "getting paid", but please keep in mind that "getting paid" means more than just money.
  Supply and Demand  
Like any product, you have supply and demand. Your supply is what you can do for a company that hires you. It's your ability to make beautiful websites. It's your ability to scale a database. It's your ability to get the best work out of others. Your supply is the  actual value  you will provide to a company that hires you.
 
Your demand is what companies  think  you can do for them. Your demand is your  perceived value  by others.

<p>Introduction: I know a lot of non-technical people who would love to work in the venture-funded startup world, from consultants to finance people to other business types for which I'm not really sure exactly what it is they do. They hit obstacles trying to get into the startup world, finding that their skills are either irrelevant or hard to explain. My advice to all these people is the same:
 
 Write a blog. 
 
A blog can improve your life in enormous ways. Or to put it in business-speak: a blog has one of the highest ROI's of anything you can do.
 
Put yourself in the shoes of startups looking for talent. First off – startups are  desperate  for talent. The problem is that it's very difficult to identify great people – startups search through loads and loads of candidates.
 
Resumes and interviews only tell you so much about a person. It's really hard to stand out in a resume – you're not the only one putting over-inflated impressive-looking numbers and bullet points on your resume. And interviews</p><p>6 0.11118186 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-24-The_inexplicable_rise_of_open_floor_plans_in_tech_companies.html">40 nathan marz storm-2014-02-24-The inexplicable rise of open floor plans in tech companies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A startup is like a rat in a maze searching for a piece of cheese. The cheese in the startup's case is  product-market fit , that pivotal point when the startup can scale and monetize the business.
 
In the maze, the startup has a dazzling amount of choices of where to go. Should we build this new feature? Should we try this new idea we have for a product? Should we backtrack and completely change our idea?
 
 Lean startups  use a strategy called "Minimum Viable Products" to help navigate the maze. The idea is that a startup formulates hypotheses about what users want or do not want; each of these hypotheses is a "turn" in the maze.

<p>Introduction: I'm the first employee of  BackType , a Summer '08 YC company. My joining the company increased the company size by 50%. The experience has been awesome, but I will say up front that being the first employee of a startup is not for everyone.
 
The best part of being the first employee of a startup is the total exposure to all parts of the company. I've learned a ton about product development, customer development, recruiting, and entrepreneurship. Additionally, I've met and connected with lots of other awesome people through the YC network. I've gotten all these benefits at relatively low risk for myself, as I still have a salary and a solid chunk of equity. 
  No Rules  
There are a lot of rules working at most companies. You don't even realize that some of the rules  are  rules until you work at a company with no rules. I'm talking about the most basic things like what hours you work, what days of the week you work, what tools you use, and whether you come into the office or not.

<p>Introduction: I ran into some very non-intuitive behavior from Clojure recently. See if you can guess what "foo" is in the following examples:
  Example 1:   user=> foo 1 user=> (= foo 1) true user=> (= [foo 2] [1 2]) true user=> (= {foo 2} {1 2}) false    Example 2:   user=> foo false user=> (= foo false) true user=> (when foo (println "shouldn't print?")) shouldn't print? nil  
Yikes, huh? Here are the answers:
 
Example 1: (def foo (Long. "1"))
 
Example 2: (def foo (Boolean. false))
 
For example 1, the map equality breaks down because Long and Integer have different hashcodes for the same numeric value. In example 2, Clojure considers anything besides false or nil to be true in a conditional, so that means a false Boolean object will be true in a conditional even though it's equal to "false".
 
I would definitely consider #1 a bug, as part of the contract of equality is that two equal objects have the same hashcode. #2 is more debatable, but it seems more intuitive that the Boolean object false</p><p>3 0.39307436 <a title="19-lda-3" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-03-10-Thrift_%2B_Graphs_%3D_Strong%2C_flexible_schemas_on_Hadoop.html">9 nathan marz storm-2010-03-10-Thrift + Graphs = Strong, flexible schemas on Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a lot of misconceptions about what Hadoop is useful for and what kind of data you can put in it. A lot of people think that Hadoop is meant for unstructured data like log files. While Hadoop is great for log files, it's also  fantastic  for strongly typed, structured data.
 
In this post I'll discuss how you can use a tool like  Thrift  to store strongly typed data in Hadoop while retaining the flexibility to evolve your schema. We'll look at graph-based schemas and see why they are an ideal fit for many Hadoop-based applications.
 
 OK, so what kind of "structured" data can you put in Hadoop? 
 
Anything! At  BackType  we put data about news, conversations, and people into Hadoop as structured objects. You can easily push structured information about social graphs, financial information, or anything you want into Hadoop. Â  
 
 That sounds all well and good, but why not just use JSON as the data format? 
 
JSON doesn't give you a real schema and doesn't protect against data i</p><p>4 0.39296696 <a title="19-lda-4" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2014/nathan_marz_storm-2014-02-12-Interview_with_%22Programmer_Magazine%22.html">39 nathan marz storm-2014-02-12-Interview with "Programmer Magazine"</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was  recently interviewed  for "Programmer Magazine", a Chinese magazine. The interview was published in Chinese, but a lot of people told me they'd like to see the English version of the interview. Due to the Google translation being, ahem, a little iffy, I decided to just publish the original English version on my blog. Hope you enjoy! 
  What drew you to programming and what was the first interesting program you wrote?  
I started programming when I was 10 years old on my TI-82 graphing calculator. Initially I started programming because I wanted to make games on my calculator – and also because I was bored in math class :D. The first interesting game I made on my calculator was an archery game where you'd shoot arrows at moving targets. You'd get points for hitting more targets or completing all the targets faster. A couple years later I graduated to programming the TI-89 which was a huge upgrade in power. I remember how the TI-82 only let you have 26 variables (for the character</p><p>5 0.37727162 <a title="19-lda-5" href="../nathan_marz_storm-2010/nathan_marz_storm-2010-10-27-Fastest_Viable_Product%3A_Investing_in_Speed_at_a_Startup.html">23 nathan marz storm-2010-10-27-Fastest Viable Product: Investing in Speed at a Startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A startup is like a rat in a maze searching for a piece of cheese. The cheese in the startup's case is  product-market fit , that pivotal point when the startup can scale and monetize the business.
 
In the maze, the startup has a dazzling amount of choices of where to go. Should we build this new feature? Should we try this new idea we have for a product? Should we backtrack and completely change our idea?
 
 Lean startups  use a strategy called "Minimum Viable Products" to help navigate the maze. The idea is that a startup formulates hypotheses about what users want or do not want; each of these hypotheses is a "turn" in the maze. A "Minimum Viable Product" is the smallest test that will let the startup know whether their "turn" was a good one. A startup wants to stop going the wrong direction as early as possible.
