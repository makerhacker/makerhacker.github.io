<p>Introduction: My name isRussell Sullivan, I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible
NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent
the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple
datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing
performance to its limits.I recently joined the NoSQL
companyAerospike(formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting
AlchemyDB's flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike's high-velocity
horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-
performanceTPS optimization project: starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the
recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012
goal:1M TPS on $5K hardware.Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server
database-requests per-second on a single machine costing $5K is a balance

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post derived from an email conversation withRussell Sullivan,
a computer architect and creator ofAlchemy Database,A Hybrid RDBMS/NOSQL-
Datastore.Russell (AKA Jak Sprats) has been pondering, considering, and
implementing distributed databases for many years. In a recent email
conversation he shared 44 of the lessons he has learned from developing the
infrastructure for high performance / highly scalable systems. Some are well
known, some are debatable, and some obviously result from a deep experience
that is worth learning from:There are maybe 20 classic bottlenecks (CPU, NIC
overload, memory fragmentation, disk seeks, swap, thread deadlock, packet
loss, etc.), have a basic understanding of them, because each is a dark
tunnel, and you need a specialised flashlight for each.The true style of
scalable architecture is rooted in the nature of bottlenecks. I always talk
aboutcommutative operationson a sharded relational model, and I figure if that
is in place, whatever is bu</p><p>5 0.11544178 <a title="1246-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-13-The_Secret_to_10_Million_Concurrent_Connections_-The_Kernel_is_the_Problem%2C_Not_the_Solution.html">1456 high scalability-2013-05-13-The Secret to 10 Million Concurrent Connections -The Kernel is the Problem, Not the Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>6 0.11430699 <a title="1246-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-19-Big_Iron_Returns_with_BigMemory.html">1118 high scalability-2011-09-19-Big Iron Returns with BigMemory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>3 0.87190253 <a title="1246-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-21-9_Principles_of_High_Performance_Programs.html">1652 high scalability-2014-05-21-9 Principles of High Performance Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>4 0.84149021 <a title="1246-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-20-8_Ways_Stardog_Made_its_Database_Insanely_Scalable.html">1582 high scalability-2014-01-20-8 Ways Stardog Made its Database Insanely Scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions

<p>Introduction: Dropboxsaves one million files every 15 minutes,  more tweets than even
Twitterers tweet. That mind blowing statistic was revealed by Rian Hunter, a
Dropbox Engineer, in his presentation How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped
at PyCon 2011.The first part of the presentation is some Dropbox lore, origin
stories and other foundational myths. We learn thatDropbox is a startup
company located in San Francisco that has probably one of the most popular
file synchronization and sharing tools in the world, shipping Python on the

<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>3 0.91268349 <a title="1246-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is aguest repost bySriram Devadas, Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform
group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a
familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of
this post.I own a small coffee shop.My expense is proportional to resources100
square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.My
shop's capacityServes 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of
coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.Since my barista works
without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,my shop's
maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour. Web serverCustomers walk away
during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to
wait.I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!ExpensesSame area and utilities, 3
