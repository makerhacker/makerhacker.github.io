<p>Introduction: Hi,     I'm   i  nterested in peop  l  es thoughts on the best choice for a database clustering so  l  ution.     I have a database that is most  l  y varchars and numbers that doesn't store any b  i  nary data at a  l  l. It's used at about 70% read and 30% wr  i  tes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not rea  l  ly hit that hard.     We're current  l  y using mysql w  i  th m/cluster, but are interested in a new so  l  ution. Possib  l  e candidate so far are unic  l  uster (which doesn't seem mature yet.) or DRBD.     Had anyone had a simi  l  ar experience and can make any suggest  i  ons?     Thanks</p><p>5 0.59006876 <a title="73-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency_Injection_and_AOP_frameworks_for_.NET_.html">685 high scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency Injection and AOP frameworks for .NET </a></p>
<p>Introduction: We're looking to implement a framework to do Dependency Injection and AOP for a new solution we're working on.  It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under pressure.  Right now, we're looking closely at Spring.NET, Castle Project's Windsor framework, and Unity.  Does anyone have any feedback on implementing any of these in large, high traffic environments?</p><p>6 0.58539814 <a title="73-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-15-New_Website_Design_Considerations.html">276 high scalability-2008-03-15-New Website Design Considerations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you turn Big Data into fast, useful, and interesting visualizations? Using  R  and technology called  Nanocubes . The visualizations are stunning and amazingly reactive. Almost as interesting as the technologies behind them.
 
David Smith wrote a  great article  explaining the technology and showing a demo by Simon Urbanek of a visualization that uses 32Tb of Twitter data. It runs smoothly and interactively on a single machine with 16Gb of RAM.  For more information and demos go to  nanocubes.net .
 
David Smith sums it up nicely:
  Despite the massive number of data points and the beauty and complexity of the real-time data visualization, it runs impressively quickly. The underlying data structure is based on Nanocubes, a fast datastructure for in-memory data cubes. The basic idea is that nanocubes aggregate data hierarchically, so that as you zoom in and out of the interactive application, one pixel on the screen is mapped to just one data point, aggregated from the many that</p><p>4 0.65720397 <a title="73-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-The_most_common_flaw_in_software_performance_testing.html">751 high scalability-2009-12-16-The most common flaw in software performance testing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>6 0.62587416 <a title="73-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-20-Smart_Companies_Fail_Because_they_Do_Everything_Right_-_Staying_Alive_to_Scale.html">1410 high scalability-2013-02-20-Smart Companies Fail Because they Do Everything Right - Staying Alive to Scale</a></p>
