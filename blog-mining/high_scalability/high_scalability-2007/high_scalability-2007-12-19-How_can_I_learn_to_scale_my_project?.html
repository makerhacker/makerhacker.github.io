Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>5 0.098795161 <a title="188-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-06-Cloud_Programming_Directly_Feeds_Cost_Allocation_Back_into_Software_Design.html">527 high scalability-2009-03-06-Cloud Programming Directly Feeds Cost Allocation Back into Software Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InMemSQL Architecture we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to
achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to
efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps
eliminate contention and make writes fast. If this all sounds a little pie-in-
the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it
clearer: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List.From the abstract:We
propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of
simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization,
searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation
before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before
physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms,
this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which
facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that

<p>Introduction: To scale in the large you have to partition. Data has to be spread around,
replicated, and kept consistent (keeping replicas sufficiently similar to one
another despite operations being submittedindependently at different sites).
The result is a highly available, well performing, and scalable
system.Partitioning is required, but it's a pain to do efficiently and
correctly. UntilQuantum teleportationbecomes a reality how data is kept
consistent across a bewildering number of failure scenarios is a key design
decision.This excellent paper by Yasushi Saito and Marc Shapiro takes us on a
wild ride (OK, maybe not so wild) of different approaches to achieving
consistency.What's cool about this paper is they go over some real systems
that we are familiar with and cover how they work: DNS (single-master, state-
transfer), Usenet (multi-master), PDAs (multi-master, state-transfer, manual
or application-specific conflict resolution), Bayou (multi-master, operation-
transfer, epidemic propagation</p><p>4 0.73150557 <a title="188-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-23-Paper%3A_CRDTs%3A_Consistency_without_concurrency_control.html">963 high scalability-2010-12-23-Paper: CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forgetThe Night Before Christmas, a heart warming
poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea
of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl
up with a some potent eggnog, nog being any drink made with rum, and read
CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control by Mihai Letia, Nuno Preguiรงa,
and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),a
data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up
consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach
[7]. The alternati</p><p>5 0.6977911 <a title="188-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Google%27s_Paxos_Made_Live_%E2%80%93_An_Engineering_Perspective.html">357 high scalability-2008-07-26-Google's Paxos Made Live – An Engineering Perspective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an unusually well written anduseful paper. It talks in detail about
experiences implementing a complex project, something we don't see very often.
They shockingly even admit that creating a working implementation of Paxos was
more difficult than just translating the pseudo code. Imagine that,
programmers aren't merely typists! I particularly like the explanation of the
Paxos algorithm and why anyone would care about it, working with disk
corruption, using leases to support simultaneous reads, using epoch numbers to
indicate a new master election, using snapshots to prevent unbounded logs,
using MultiOp to implement database transactions, how they tested the system,
and their openness with the various problems they had. A lot to learn
here.From the paper:We describe our experience building a fault-tolerant data-
base using the Paxos consensus algorithm. Despite the existing literature in
the field, building such a database proved to be non-trivial. We describe

<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>2 0.87473053 <a title="188-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-11-Ask_HS%3A_What_is_a_good_OLAP_database_choice_with_node.js%3F.html">1546 high scalability-2013-11-11-Ask HS: What is a good OLAP database choice with node.js?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.With a business associate, I am trying to develop a
financial software that handles financial reports of listed companies. We
managed to create this database with all the data necessary to do financial
analysis. My associate is a Business Intelligence specialist so he is keen to
use OLAPs databases like Microsoft Analysis Services or Jedox Palo, which
enables in-memory calculations and very fast aggregation, slicing and dicing
of data or write-backs.At the same time I did an online course (MOOC) from
Stanford CS184 called Startup Engineering which promoted/talked a lot about
javascript and especially node.js as the language of the future for servers.As
I am keen to use open-source technologies (would be keen to avoid MS SSAS) for
the development of a website to access this financial data , and there are so
many choices for databases out there (Postgre, MongoDB, MySQL etc..but don't

<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinatingslam by slam recountof how
hisFaceStat(upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered
by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000
page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its
own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning
theGreat Eyeof the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite
the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such
events inThe Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture:
massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a
fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly
FaceStat's situation.This is also one of our first exposures to an application
written on Merb, a popular Ruby on Rails competitor. For those who think Ruby
is the problem, their architecture now serves 100 times the original load.How

<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query
