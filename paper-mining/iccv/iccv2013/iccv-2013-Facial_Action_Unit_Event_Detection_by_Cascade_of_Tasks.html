<p>Author: Ziheng Wang, Yongqiang Li, Shangfei Wang, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of facial action unit (AU) recognition by exploiting the complex semantic relationships among AUs, which carry crucial top-down information yet have not been thoroughly exploited. Towards this goal, we build a hierarchical model that combines the bottom-level image features and the top-level AU relationships to jointly recognize AUs in a principled manner. The proposed model has two major advantages over existing methods. 1) Unlike methods that can only capture local pair-wise AU dependencies, our model is developed upon the restricted Boltzmann machine and therefore can exploit the global relationships among AUs. 2) Although AU relationships are influenced by many related factors such as facial expressions, these factors are generally ignored by the current methods. Our model, however, can successfully capture them to more accurately characterize the AU relationships. Efficient learning and inference algorithms of the proposed model are also developed. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in modelling complex AU relationships as well as its superior AU recognition performance over existing approaches.</p><p>3 0.11902016 <a title="155-tfidf-3" href="./iccv-2013-Fast_Face_Detector_Training_Using_Tailored_Views.html">157 iccv-2013-Fast Face Detector Training Using Tailored Views</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristina Scherbaum, James Petterson, Rogerio S. Feris, Volker Blanz, Hans-Peter Seidel</p><p>Abstract: Face detection is an important task in computer vision and often serves as the first step for a variety of applications. State-of-the-art approaches use efficient learning algorithms and train on large amounts of manually labeled imagery. Acquiring appropriate training images, however, is very time-consuming and does not guarantee that the collected training data is representative in terms of data variability. Moreover, available data sets are often acquired under controlled settings, restricting, for example, scene illumination or 3D head pose to a narrow range. This paper takes a look into the automated generation of adaptive training samples from a 3D morphable face model. Using statistical insights, the tailored training data guarantees full data variability and is enriched by arbitrary facial attributes such as age or body weight. Moreover, it can automatically adapt to environmental constraints, such as illumination or viewing angle of recorded video footage from surveillance cameras. We use the tailored imagery to train a new many-core imple- mentation of Viola Jones ’ AdaBoost object detection framework. The new implementation is not only faster but also enables the use of multiple feature channels such as color features at training time. In our experiments we trained seven view-dependent face detectors and evaluate these on the Face Detection Data Set and Benchmark (FDDB). Our experiments show that the use of tailored training imagery outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on this challenging dataset.</p><p>4 0.11800966 <a title="155-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Slow_Features_for_Behaviour_Analysis.html">243 iccv-2013-Learning Slow Features for Behaviour Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Lazaros Zafeiriou, Mihalis A. Nicolaou, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Symeon Nikitidis, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: A recently introduced latent feature learning technique for time varying dynamic phenomena analysis is the socalled Slow Feature Analysis (SFA). SFA is a deterministic component analysis technique for multi-dimensional sequences that by minimizing the variance of the first order time derivative approximation of the input signal finds uncorrelated projections that extract slowly-varying features ordered by their temporal consistency and constancy. In this paper, we propose a number of extensions in both the deterministic and the probabilistic SFA optimization frameworks. In particular, we derive a novel deterministic SFA algorithm that is able to identify linear projections that extract the common slowest varying features of two or more sequences. In addition, we propose an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to perform inference in a probabilistic formulation of SFA and similarly extend it in order to handle two and more time varying data sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate that the probabilistic SFA (EMSFA) algorithm that discovers the common slowest varying latent space of multiple sequences can be combined with dynamic time warping techniques for robust sequence timealignment. The proposed SFA algorithms were applied for facial behavior analysis demonstrating their usefulness and appropriateness for this task.</p><p>5 0.11022685 <a title="155-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-Random_Faces_Guided_Sparse_Many-to-One_Encoder_for_Pose-Invariant_Face_Recognition.html">335 iccv-2013-Random Faces Guided Sparse Many-to-One Encoder for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yizhe Zhang, Ming Shao, Edward K. Wong, Yun Fu</p><p>Abstract: One of the most challenging task in face recognition is to identify people with varied poses. Namely, the test faces have significantly different poses compared with the registered faces. In this paper, we propose a high-level feature learning scheme to extract pose-invariant identity feature for face recognition. First, we build a single-hiddenlayer neural network with sparse constraint, to extractposeinvariant feature in a supervised fashion. Second, we further enhance the discriminative capability of the proposed feature by using multiple random faces as the target values for multiple encoders. By enforcing the target values to be uniquefor inputfaces over differentposes, the learned highlevel feature that is represented by the neurons in the hidden layer is pose free and only relevant to the identity information. Finally, we conduct face identification on CMU MultiPIE, and verification on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) databases, where identification rank-1 accuracy and face verification accuracy with ROC curve are reported. These experiments demonstrate that our model is superior to oth- er state-of-the-art approaches on handling pose variations.</p><p>6 0.09325517 <a title="155-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_3D_Facial_Capture_Using_a_Single_RGBD_Camera.html">36 iccv-2013-Accurate and Robust 3D Facial Capture Using a Single RGBD Camera</a></p>

<p>Author: Yifan Zhang, Qiang Ji, Hanqing Lu</p><p>Abstract: In complex scenes with multiple atomic events happening sequentially or in parallel, detecting each individual event separately may not always obtain robust and reliable result. It is essential to detect them in a holistic way which incorporates the causality and temporal dependency among them to compensate the limitation of current computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose an interval temporal constrained dynamic Bayesian network to extendAllen ’s interval algebra network (IAN) [2]from a deterministic static model to a probabilistic dynamic system, which can not only capture the complex interval temporal relationships, but also model the evolution dynamics and handle the uncertainty from the noisy visual observation. In the model, the topology of the IAN on each time slice and the interlinks between the time slices are discovered by an advanced structure learning method. The duration of the event and the unsynchronized time lags between two correlated event intervals are captured by a duration model, so that we can better determine the temporal boundary of the event. Empirical results on two real world datasets show the power of the proposed interval temporal constrained model.</p><p>5 0.51443148 <a title="155-lsi-5" href="./iccv-2013-Like_Father%2C_Like_Son%3A_Facial_Expression_Dynamics_for_Kinship_Verification.html">251 iccv-2013-Like Father, Like Son: Facial Expression Dynamics for Kinship Verification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi-Lei Chen, Chiou-Ting Hsu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank appearance model for removing rain streaks. Different from previous work, our method needs neither rain pixel detection nor time-consuming dictionary learning stage. Instead, as rain streaks usually reveal similar and repeated patterns on imaging scene, we propose and generalize a low-rank model from matrix to tensor structure in order to capture the spatio-temporally correlated rain streaks. With the appearance model, we thus remove rain streaks from image/video (and also other high-order image structure) in a unified way. Our experimental results demonstrate competitive (or even better) visual quality and efficient run-time in comparison with state of the art.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71152294 <a title="155-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Facial_Action_Unit_Event_Detection_by_Cascade_of_Tasks.html">155 iccv-2013-Facial Action Unit Event Detection by Cascade of Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoyu Ding, Wen-Sheng Chu, Fernando De_La_Torre, Jeffery F. Cohn, Qiao Wang</p><p>Abstract: Automatic facial Action Unit (AU) detection from video is a long-standing problem in facial expression analysis. AU detection is typically posed as a classification problem between frames or segments of positive examples and negative ones, where existing work emphasizes the use of different features or classifiers. In this paper, we propose a method called Cascade of Tasks (CoT) that combines the use ofdifferent tasks (i.e., , frame, segment and transition)for AU event detection. We train CoT in a sequential manner embracing diversity, which ensures robustness and generalization to unseen data. In addition to conventional framebased metrics that evaluate frames independently, we propose a new event-based metric to evaluate detection performance at event-level. We show how the CoT method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both frame-based and event-based metrics, across three public datasets that differ in complexity: CK+, FERA and RUFACS.</p><p>3 0.68118536 <a title="155-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Video_Event_Understanding_Using_Natural_Language_Descriptions.html">440 iccv-2013-Video Event Understanding Using Natural Language Descriptions</a></p>
<p>Author: Vignesh Ramanathan, Percy Liang, Li Fei-Fei</p><p>Abstract: Human action and role recognition play an important part in complex event understanding. State-of-the-art methods learn action and role models from detailed spatio temporal annotations, which requires extensive human effort. In this work, we propose a method to learn such models based on natural language descriptions of the training videos, which are easier to collect and scale with the number of actions and roles. There are two challenges with using this form of weak supervision: First, these descriptions only provide a high-level summary and often do not directly mention the actions and roles occurring in a video. Second, natural language descriptions do not provide spatio temporal annotations of actions and roles. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a topic-based semantic relatedness (SR) measure between a video description and an action and role label, and incorporate it into a posterior regularization objective. Our event recognition system based on these action and role models matches the state-ofthe-art method on the TRECVID-MED11 event kit, despite weaker supervision.</p><p>4 0.67144948 <a title="155-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Global_Fusion_of_Relative_Motions_for_Robust%2C_Accurate_and_Scalable_Structure_from_Motion.html">184 iccv-2013-Global Fusion of Relative Motions for Robust, Accurate and Scalable Structure from Motion</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Moulon, Pascal Monasse, Renaud Marlet</p><p>Abstract: Multi-view structure from motion (SfM) estimates the position and orientation of pictures in a common 3D coordinate frame. When views are treated incrementally, this external calibration can be subject to drift, contrary to global methods that distribute residual errors evenly. We propose a new global calibration approach based on the fusion of relative motions between image pairs. We improve an existing method for robustly computing global rotations. We present an efficient a contrario trifocal tensor estimation method, from which stable and precise translation directions can be extracted. We also define an efficient translation registration method that recovers accurate camera positions. These components are combined into an original SfM pipeline. Our experiments show that, on most datasets, it outperforms in accuracy other existing incremental and global pipelines. It also achieves strikingly good running times: it is about 20 times faster than the other global method we could compare to, and as fast as the best incremental method. More importantly, it features better scalability properties.</p><p>5 0.65890628 <a title="155-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Orderless_Tracking_through_Model-Averaged_Posterior_Estimation.html">303 iccv-2013-Orderless Tracking through Model-Averaged Posterior Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Seunghoon Hong, Suha Kwak, Bohyung Han</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel offline tracking algorithm based on model-averaged posterior estimation through patch matching across frames. Contrary to existing online and offline tracking methods, our algorithm is not based on temporallyordered estimates of target state but attempts to select easyto-track frames first out of the remaining ones without exploiting temporal coherency of target. The posterior of the selected frame is estimated by propagating densities from the already tracked frames in a recursive manner. The density propagation across frames is implemented by an efficient patch matching technique, which is useful for our algorithm since it does not require motion smoothness assumption. Also, we present a hierarchical approach, where a small set of key frames are tracked first and non-key frames are handled by local key frames. Our tracking algorithm is conceptually well-suited for the sequences with abrupt motion, shot changes, and occlusion. We compare our tracking algorithm with existing techniques in real videos with such challenges and illustrate its superior performance qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>6 0.62187958 <a title="155-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-STAR3D%3A_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Reconstruction_of_3D_Objects_Using_RGB-D_Data.html">366 iccv-2013-STAR3D: Simultaneous Tracking and Reconstruction of 3D Objects Using RGB-D Data</a></p>
