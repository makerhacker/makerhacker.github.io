<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this video:  Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset . Karoly states the general theme of the changes as:  You give up some control and you get back scalability . An interesting comment on the politics of scalability?
 
Makeover may not be quite the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.

<p>Introduction: Hi,         I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or dedicated).       Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB .... and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg.... that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....         Wanted to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same server?         what are the things that i should look into if i should make this happen?</p><p>6 0.082800403 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability_has_Moved_to_Squarespace.com%21_.html">714 high scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability has Moved to Squarespace.com! </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Easy FTP redundancy and consolidation with the Open Source project Generic-FTP. Works with probably any Linux FTP Server (ProFTPD only one tested). Get rid of some single points of failure. A very easy to set up solution using scripts written in PHP. Tested thoroughly in a production environment.</p><p>3 0.57662058 <a title="146-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>4 0.57239413 <a title="146-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the application that will become critical over time.</p><p>5 0.56824934 <a title="146-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Limelight says  95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days  and 88.8 percent of views take place in the first 30 days.
 
Since a lot of people are working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication: there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30 days.</p><p>6 0.56734103 <a title="146-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>
