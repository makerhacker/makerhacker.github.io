<p>Author: Danushka Bollegala ; David Weir ; John Carroll</p><p>Abstract: We describe a sentiment classification method that is applicable when we do not have any labeled data for a target domain but have some labeled data for multiple other domains, designated as the source domains. We automat- ically create a sentiment sensitive thesaurus using both labeled and unlabeled data from multiple source domains to find the association between words that express similar sentiments in different domains. The created thesaurus is then used to expand feature vectors to train a binary classifier. Unlike previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods, our method can efficiently learn from multiple source domains. Our method significantly outperforms numerous baselines and returns results that are better than or comparable to previous cross-domain sentiment classification methods on a benchmark dataset containing Amazon user reviews for different types of products.</p><p>3 0.38923976 <a title="218-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">204 acl-2011-Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

Ng ; Christopher Potts</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised vector-based approaches to semantics can model rich lexical meanings, but they largely fail to capture sentiment information that is central to many word meanings and important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We present a model that uses a mix of unsupervised and supervised techniques to learn word vectors capturing semanticterm–documentinformation as well as rich sentiment content. The proposed model can leverage both continuous and multi-dimensional sentiment information as well as non-sentiment annotations. We instantiate the model to utilize the document-level sentiment polarity annotations present in many online documents (e.g. star ratings). We evaluate the model using small, widely used sentiment and subjectivity corpora and find it out-performs several previously introduced methods for sentiment classification. We also introduce a large dataset , of movie reviews to serve as a more robust benchmark for work in this area.</p><p>4 0.33957252 <a title="218-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet.html">253 acl-2011-PsychoSentiWordNet</a></p>

<p>Author: Jui-Yu Weng ; Cheng-Lun Yang ; Bo-Nian Chen ; Yen-Kai Wang ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system to summarize a Microblog post and its responses with the goal to provide readers a more constructive and concise set of information for efficient digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>6 0.33779261 <a title="218-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Target-dependent_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification.html">292 acl-2011-Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Oscar Tackstrom ; Ryan McDonald</p><p>Abstract: We derive two variants of a semi-supervised model for fine-grained sentiment analysis. Both models leverage abundant natural supervision in the form of review ratings, as well as a small amount of manually crafted sentence labels, to learn sentence-level sentiment classifiers. The proposed model is a fusion of a fully supervised structured conditional model and its partially supervised counterpart. This allows for highly efficient estimation and inference algorithms with rich feature definitions. We describe the two variants as well as their component models and verify experimentally that both variants give significantly improved results for sentence-level sentiment analysis compared to all baselines. 1 Sentence-level sentiment analysis In this paper, we demonstrate how combining coarse-grained and fine-grained supervision benefits sentence-level sentiment analysis an important task in the field of opinion classification and retrieval (Pang and Lee, 2008). Typical supervised learning approaches to sentence-level sentiment analysis rely on sentence-level supervision. While such fine-grained supervision rarely exist naturally, and thus requires labor intensive manual annotation effort (Wiebe et al., 2005), coarse-grained supervision is naturally abundant in the form of online review ratings. This coarse-grained supervision is, of course, less informative compared to fine-grained supervision, however, by combining a small amount of sentence-level supervision with a large amount of document-level supervision, we are able to substantially improve on the sentence-level classification task. Our work combines two strands of research: models for sentiment analysis that take document structure into account; – 569 Ryan McDonald Google, Inc., New York ryanmcd@ google com . and models that use latent variables to learn unobserved phenomena from that which can be observed. Exploiting document structure for sentiment analysis has attracted research attention since the early work of Pang and Lee (2004), who performed minimal cuts in a sentence graph to select subjective sentences. McDonald et al. (2007) later showed that jointly learning fine-grained (sentence) and coarsegrained (document) sentiment improves predictions at both levels. More recently, Yessenalina et al. (2010) described how sentence-level latent variables can be used to improve document-level prediction and Nakagawa et al. (2010) used latent variables over syntactic dependency trees to improve sentence-level prediction, using only labeled sentences for training. In a similar vein, Sauper et al. (2010) integrated generative content structure models with discriminative models for multi-aspect sentiment summarization and ranking. These approaches all rely on the availability of fine-grained annotations, but Ta¨ckstro¨m and McDonald (201 1) showed that latent variables can be used to learn fine-grained sentiment using only coarse-grained supervision. While this model was shown to beat a set of natural baselines with quite a wide margin, it has its shortcomings. Most notably, due to the loose constraints provided by the coarse supervision, it tends to only predict the two dominant fine-grained sentiment categories well for each document sentiment category, so that almost all sentences in positive documents are deemed positive or neutral, and vice versa for negative documents. As a way of overcoming these shortcomings, we propose to fuse a coarsely supervised model with a fully supervised model. Below, we describe two ways of achieving such a combined model in the framework of structured conditional latent variable models. Contrary to (generative) topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and Proceedings ofP thoer t4l9atnhd A, Onrnuegaoln M,e Jeuntineg 19 o-f2 t4h,e 2 A0s1s1o.c?i ac t2io0n11 fo Ar Cssoocmiaptuiotanti foonra Clo Lminpguutiast i ocns:aslh Loirntpgaupisetrics , pages 569–574, Figure 1: a) Factor graph of the fully observed graphical model. b) Factor graph of the corresponding latent variable model. During training, shaded nodes are observed, while non-shaded nodes are unobserved. The input sentences si are always observed. Note that there are no factors connecting the document node, yd, with the input nodes, s, so that the sentence-level variables, ys, in effect form a bottleneck between the document sentiment and the input sentences. McDonald, 2008; Lin and He, 2009), structured conditional models can handle rich and overlapping features and allow for exact inference and simple gradient based estimation. The former models are largely orthogonal to the one we propose in this work and combining their merits might be fruitful. As shown by Sauper et al. (2010), it is possible to fuse generative document structure models and task specific structured conditional models. While we do model document structure in terms of sentiment transitions, we do not model topical structure. An interesting avenue for future work would be to extend the model of Sauper et al. (2010) to take coarse-grained taskspecific supervision into account, while modeling fine-grained task-specific aspects with latent variables. Note also that the proposed approach is orthogonal to semi-supervised and unsupervised induction of context independent (prior polarity) lexicons (Turney, 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009; Velikovich et al., 2010). The output of such models could readily be incorporated as features in the proposed model. 1.1 Preliminaries Let d be a document consisting of n sentences, s = (si)in=1, with a document–sentence-sequence pair denoted d = (d, s). Let yd = (yd, ys) denote random variables1 the document level sentiment, yd, and the sequence of sentence level sentiment, = (ysi)in=1 . – ys 1We are abusing notation throughout by using the same symbols to refer to random variables and their particular assignments. 570 In what follows, we assume that we have access to two training sets: a small set of fully labeled instances, DF = {(dj, and a large set of ydj)}jm=f1, coarsely labeled instances DC = {(dj, yjd)}jm=fm+fm+c1. Furthermore, we assume that yd and all yis take values in {POS, NEG, NEU}. We focus on structured conditional models in the exponential family, with the standard parametrization pθ(yd,ys|s) = expnhφ(yd,ys,s),θi − Aθ(s)o</p><p>5 0.72406912 <a title="218-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Target-dependent_Twitter_Sentiment_Classification.html">292 acl-2011-Target-dependent Twitter Sentiment Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Jiang ; Mo Yu ; Ming Zhou ; Xiaohua Liu ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we focus on target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification; namely, given a query, we classify the sentiments of the tweets as positive, negative or neutral according to whether they contain positive, negative or neutral sentiments about that query. Here the query serves as the target of the sentiments. The state-ofthe-art approaches for solving this problem always adopt the target-independent strategy, which may assign irrelevant sentiments to the given target. Moreover, the state-of-the-art approaches only take the tweet to be classified into consideration when classifying the sentiment; they ignore its context (i.e., related tweets). However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose to improve target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification by 1) incorporating target-dependent features; and 2) taking related tweets into consideration. According to the experimental results, our approach greatly improves the performance of target-dependent sentiment classification. 1</p><p>6 0.71933788 <a title="218-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Word_Vectors_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">204 acl-2011-Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Cheng-Te Li ; Chien-Yuan Wang ; Chien-Lin Tseng ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: Micro-blogging services provide platforms for users to share their feelings and ideas on the move. In this paper, we present a search-based demonstration system, called MemeTube, to summarize the sentiments of microblog messages in an audiovisual manner. MemeTube provides three main functions: (1) recognizing the sentiments of messages (2) generating music melody automatically based on detected sentiments, and (3) produce an animation of real-time piano playing for audiovisual display. Our MemeTube system can be accessed via: http://mslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/memetube/ .</p><p>2 0.58383971 <a title="218-lda-2" href="./acl-2011-SciSumm%3A_A_Multi-Document_Summarization_System_for_Scientific_Articles.html">270 acl-2011-SciSumm: A Multi-Document Summarization System for Scientific Articles</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitin Agarwal ; Ravi Shankar Reddy ; Kiran GVR ; Carolyn Penstein Rose</p><p>Abstract: In this demo, we present SciSumm, an interactive multi-document summarization system for scientific articles. The document collection to be summarized is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation. At the heart of the approach is a topic based clustering of fragments extracted from each article based on queries generated from the context surrounding the co-cited list of papers. This analysis enables the generation of an overview of common themes from the co-cited papers that relate to the context in which the co-citation was found. SciSumm is currently built over the 2008 ACL Anthology, however the gen- eralizable nature of the summarization techniques and the extensible architecture makes it possible to use the system with other corpora where a citation network is available. Evaluation results on the same corpus demonstrate that our system performs better than an existing widely used multi-document summarization system (MEAD).</p><p>3 0.58045846 <a title="218-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-Sentiment_Analysis_of_Citations_using_Sentence_Structure-Based_Features.html">281 acl-2011-Sentiment Analysis of Citations using Sentence Structure-Based Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Awais Athar</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific papers and articles is a new and interesting problem due to the many linguistic differences between scientific texts and other genres. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatic identification of positive and negative sentiment polarity in citations to scientific papers. Using a newly constructed annotated citation sentiment corpus, we explore the effectiveness of existing and novel features, including n-grams, specialised science-specific lexical features, dependency relations, sentence splitting and negation features. Our results show that 3-grams and dependencies perform best in this task; they outperform the sentence splitting, science lexicon and negation based features.</p><p>4 0.57802892 <a title="218-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Towards_Style_Transformation_from_Written-Style_to_Audio-Style.html">306 acl-2011-Towards Style Transformation from Written-Style to Audio-Style</a></p>
<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Barbara Rosario ; Kent Lyons</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the style of textual content to make it more suitable to being listened to by a user as opposed to being read. We study the differences between the written style and the audio style by consulting the linguistics andjour- nalism literatures. Guided by this study, we suggest a number of linguistic features to distinguish between the two styles. We show the correctness of our features and the impact of style transformation on the user experience through statistical analysis, a style classification task, and a user study.</p><p>5 0.56850302 <a title="218-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-Learning_Sub-Word_Units_for_Open_Vocabulary_Speech_Recognition.html">203 acl-2011-Learning Sub-Word Units for Open Vocabulary Speech Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Carolina Parada ; Mark Dredze ; Abhinav Sethy ; Ariya Rastrow</p><p>Abstract: Large vocabulary speech recognition systems fail to recognize words beyond their vocabulary, many of which are information rich terms, like named entities or foreign words. Hybrid word/sub-word systems solve this problem by adding sub-word units to large vocabulary word based systems; new words can then be represented by combinations of subword units. Previous work heuristically created the sub-word lexicon from phonetic representations of text using simple statistics to select common phone sequences. We propose a probabilistic model to learn the subword lexicon optimized for a given task. We consider the task of out of vocabulary (OOV) word detection, which relies on output from a hybrid model. A hybrid model with our learned sub-word lexicon reduces error by 6.3% and 7.6% (absolute) at a 5% false alarm rate on an English Broadcast News and MIT Lectures task respectively.</p><p>6 0.56538528 <a title="218-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Prefix_Probability_for_Probabilistic_Synchronous_Context-Free_Grammars.html">250 acl-2011-Prefix Probability for Probabilistic Synchronous Context-Free Grammars</a></p>
