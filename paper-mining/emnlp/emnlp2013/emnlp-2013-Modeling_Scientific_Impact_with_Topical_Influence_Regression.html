<p>Author: Peter Rebersek ; Mateja Verlic</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to automatic creation of anchor texts for hyperlinks in a document pointing to similar documents. Methods used in this approach rank parts of a document based on the similarity to a presumably related document. Ranks are then used to automatically construct the best anchor text for a link inside original document to the compared document. A number of different methods from information retrieval and natural language processing are adapted for this task. Automatically constructed anchor texts are manually evaluated in terms of relatedness to linked documents and compared to baseline consisting of originally inserted anchor texts. Additionally we use crowdsourcing for evaluation of original anchors and au- tomatically constructed anchors. Results show that our best adapted methods rival the precision of the baseline method.</p><p>3 0.11198658 <a title="133-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Detecting_Promotional_Content_in_Wikipedia.html">61 emnlp-2013-Detecting Promotional Content in Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhiyuan Chen ; Arjun Mukherjee ; Bing Liu ; Meichun Hsu ; Malu Castellanos ; Riddhiman Ghosh</p><p>Abstract: Aspect extraction is one of the key tasks in sentiment analysis. In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task. However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems, which is based on an Extended generalized Pólya urn (E-GPU) model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that MCLDA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models markedly.</p><p>5 0.091297783 <a title="133-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Building_Event_Threads_out_of_Multiple_News_Articles.html">41 emnlp-2013-Building Event Threads out of Multiple News Articles</a></p>

<p>Author: John Philip McCrae ; Philipp Cimiano ; Roman Klinger</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modelling has applications in machine translation, word sense disambiguation and terminology alignment. Multilingual extensions of approaches based on latent (LSI), generative (LDA, PLSI) as well as explicit (ESA) topic modelling can induce an interlingual topic space allowing documents in different languages to be mapped into the same space and thus to be compared across languages. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines latent and explicit topic modelling approaches in the sense that it builds on a set of explicitly defined topics, but then computes latent relations between these. Thus, the method combines the benefits of both explicit and latent topic modelling approaches. We show that on a crosslingual mate retrieval task, our model significantly outperforms LDA, LSI, and ESA, as well as a baseline that translates every word in a document into the target language.</p><p>6 0.42627603 <a title="133-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2013-A_Discourse-Driven_Content_Model_for_Summarising_Scientific_Articles_Evaluated_in_a_Complex_Question_Answering_Task.html">5 emnlp-2013-A Discourse-Driven Content Model for Summarising Scientific Articles Evaluated in a Complex Question Answering Task</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhongqing Wang ; Shoushan LI ; Fang Kong ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook.com is at the core of many interesting applications, such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising. However, personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information. Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them. In this paper, we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks. Here, using social networks is motivated by the intuition that, people with similar academic, business or social connections (e.g. co-major, co-university, and cocorporation) tend to have similar experience and summaries. To achieve the learning process, we propose a collective factor graph (CoFG) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn.com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>3 0.61688739 <a title="133-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2013-Max-Margin_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction_for_Machine_Translation.html">127 emnlp-2013-Max-Margin Synchronous Grammar Induction for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinyan Xiao ; Deyi Xiong</p><p>Abstract: Traditional synchronous grammar induction estimates parameters by maximizing likelihood, which only has a loose relation to translation quality. Alternatively, we propose a max-margin estimation approach to discriminatively inducing synchronous grammars for machine translation, which directly optimizes translation quality measured by BLEU. In the max-margin estimation of parameters, we only need to calculate Viterbi translations. This further facilitates the incorporation of various non-local features that are defined on the target side. We test the effectiveness of our max-margin estimation framework on a competitive hierarchical phrase-based system. Experiments show that our max-margin method significantly outperforms the traditional twostep pipeline for synchronous rule extraction by 1.3 BLEU points and is also better than previous max-likelihood estimation method.</p><p>4 0.61296594 <a title="133-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2013-Structured_Penalties_for_Log-Linear_Language_Models.html">176 emnlp-2013-Structured Penalties for Log-Linear Language Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Anil Kumar Nelakanti ; Cedric Archambeau ; Julien Mairal ; Francis Bach ; Guillaume Bouchard</p><p>Abstract: Language models can be formalized as loglinear regression models where the input features represent previously observed contexts up to a certain length m. The complexity of existing algorithms to learn the parameters by maximum likelihood scale linearly in nd, where n is the length of the training corpus and d is the number of observed features. We present a model that grows logarithmically in d, making it possible to efficiently leverage longer contexts. We account for the sequential structure of natural language using treestructured penalized objectives to avoid overfitting and achieve better generalization.</p><p>5 0.61260319 <a title="133-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2013-Combining_PCFG-LA_Models_with_Dual_Decomposition%3A_A_Case_Study_with_Function_Labels_and_Binarization.html">50 emnlp-2013-Combining PCFG-LA Models with Dual Decomposition: A Case Study with Function Labels and Binarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Le Roux ; Antoine Rozenknop ; Jennifer Foster</p><p>Abstract: It has recently been shown that different NLP models can be effectively combined using dual decomposition. In this paper we demonstrate that PCFG-LA parsing models are suitable for combination in this way. We experiment with the different models which result from alternative methods of extracting a grammar from a treebank (retaining or discarding function labels, left binarization versus right binarization) and achieve a labeled Parseval F-score of 92.4 on Wall Street Journal Section 23 this represents an absolute improvement of 0.7 and an error reduction rate of 7% over a strong PCFG-LA product-model baseline. Although we experiment only with binarization and function labels in this study, there is much scope for applying this approach to – other grammar extraction strategies.</p><p>6 0.61248153 <a title="133-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2013-Translation_with_Source_Constituency_and_Dependency_Trees.html">187 emnlp-2013-Translation with Source Constituency and Dependency Trees</a></p>
