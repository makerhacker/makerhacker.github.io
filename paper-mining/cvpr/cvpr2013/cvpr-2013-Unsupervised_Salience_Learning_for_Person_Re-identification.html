<p>Author: Huaizu Jiang, Jingdong Wang, Zejian Yuan, Yang Wu, Nanning Zheng, Shipeng Li</p><p>Abstract: Salient object detection has been attracting a lot of interest, and recently various heuristic computational models have been designed. In this paper, we regard saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, uses the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score, and finally fuses the saliency scores across multiple levels, yielding the saliency map. The contributions lie in two-fold. One is that we show our approach, which integrates the regional contrast, regional property and regional backgroundness descriptors together to form the master saliency map, is able to produce superior saliency maps to existing algorithms most of which combine saliency maps heuristically computed from different types of features. The other is that we introduce a new regional feature vector, backgroundness, to characterize the background, which can be regarded as a counterpart of the objectness descriptor [2]. The performance evaluation on several popular benchmark data sets validates that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-arts.</p><p>3 0.45993647 <a title="451-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Detection_via_Graph-Based_Manifold_Ranking.html">375 cvpr-2013-Saliency Detection via Graph-Based Manifold Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chuan Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Xiang Ruan, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: Most existing bottom-up methods measure the foreground saliency of a pixel or region based on its contrast within a local context or the entire image, whereas a few methods focus on segmenting out background regions and thereby salient objects. Instead of considering the contrast between the salient objects and their surrounding regions, we consider both foreground and background cues in a different way. We rank the similarity of the image elements (pixels or regions) with foreground cues or background cues via graph-based manifold ranking. The saliency of the image elements is defined based on their relevances to the given seeds or queries. We represent the image as a close-loop graph with superpixels as nodes. These nodes are ranked based on the similarity to background and foreground queries, based on affinity matrices. Saliency detection is carried out in a two-stage scheme to extract background regions and foreground salient objects efficiently. Experimental results on two large benchmark databases demonstrate the proposed method performs well when against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We also create a more difficult bench- mark database containing 5,172 images to test the proposed saliency model and make this database publicly available with this paper for further studies in the saliency field.</p><p>4 0.44250691 <a title="451-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Looking_Beyond_the_Image%3A_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Object_Saliency_and_Detection.html">273 cvpr-2013-Looking Beyond the Image: Unsupervised Learning for Object Saliency and Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Parthipan Siva, Chris Russell, Tao Xiang, Lourdes Agapito</p><p>Abstract: We propose a principled probabilistic formulation of object saliency as a sampling problem. This novel formulation allows us to learn, from a large corpus of unlabelled images, which patches of an image are of the greatest interest and most likely to correspond to an object. We then sample the object saliency map to propose object locations. We show that using only a single object location proposal per image, we are able to correctly select an object in over 42% of the images in the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, substantially outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, we show that our object proposal can be used as a simple unsupervised approach to the weakly supervised annotation problem. Our simple unsupervised approach to annotating objects of interest in images achieves a higher annotation accuracy than most weakly supervised approaches.</p><p>5 0.41928732 <a title="451-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Hierarchical_Saliency_Detection.html">202 cvpr-2013-Hierarchical Saliency Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiong Yan, Li Xu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia</p><p>Abstract: When dealing with objects with complex structures, saliency detection confronts a critical problem namely that detection accuracy could be adversely affected if salient foreground or background in an image contains small-scale high-contrast patterns. This issue is common in natural images and forms a fundamental challenge for prior methods. We tackle it from a scale point of view and propose a multi-layer approach to analyze saliency cues. The final saliency map is produced in a hierarchical model. Different from varying patch sizes or downsizing images, our scale-based region handling is by finding saliency values optimally in a tree model. Our approach improves saliency detection on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. A new dataset is also constructed. –</p><p>6 0.41360512 <a title="451-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-PISA%3A_Pixelwise_Image_Saliency_by_Aggregating_Complementary_Appearance_Contrast_Measures_with_Spatial_Priors.html">322 cvpr-2013-PISA: Pixelwise Image Saliency by Aggregating Complementary Appearance Contrast Measures with Spatial Priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Keyang Shi, Keze Wang, Jiangbo Lu, Liang Lin</p><p>Abstract: Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, assigning pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly critical. More often, such fine-grained saliency detection is also desired to have a fast runtime. Motivated by these, we propose a generic and fast computational framework called PISA Pixelwise Image Saliency Aggregating complementary saliency cues based on color and structure contrasts with spatial priors holistically. Overcoming the limitations of previous methods often using homogeneous superpixel-based and color contrast-only treatment, our PISA approach directly performs saliency modeling for each individual pixel and makes use of densely overlapping, feature-adaptive observations for saliency measure computation. We further impose a spatial prior term on each of the two contrast measures, which constrains pixels rendered salient to be compact and also centered in image domain. By fusing complementary contrast measures in such a pixelwise adaptive manner, the detection effectiveness is significantly boosted. Without requiring reliable region segmentation or post– relaxation, PISA exploits an efficient edge-aware image representation and filtering technique and produces spatially coherent yet detail-preserving saliency maps. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate PISA’s superior detection accuracy and competitive runtime speed over the state-of-the-arts approaches.</p><p>3 0.81430066 <a title="451-lsi-3" href="./cvpr-2013-What_Makes_a_Patch_Distinct%3F.html">464 cvpr-2013-What Makes a Patch Distinct?</a></p>
<p>Author: Ran Margolin, Ayellet Tal, Lihi Zelnik-Manor</p><p>Abstract: What makes an object salient? Most previous work assert that distinctness is the dominating factor. The difference between the various algorithms is in the way they compute distinctness. Some focus on the patterns, others on the colors, and several add high-level cues and priors. We propose a simple, yet powerful, algorithm that integrates these three factors. Our key contribution is a novel and fast approach to compute pattern distinctness. We rely on the inner statistics of the patches in the image for identifying unique patterns. We provide an extensive evaluation and show that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the five most commonly-used datasets.</p><p>4 0.81065297 <a title="451-lsi-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Saliency_Aggregation%3A_A_Data-Driven_Approach.html">374 cvpr-2013-Saliency Aggregation: A Data-Driven Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Mai, Yuzhen Niu, Feng Liu</p><p>Abstract: A variety of methods have been developed for visual saliency analysis. These methods often complement each other. This paper addresses the problem of aggregating various saliency analysis methods such that the aggregation result outperforms each individual one. We have two major observations. First, different methods perform differently in saliency analysis. Second, the performance of a saliency analysis method varies with individual images. Our idea is to use data-driven approaches to saliency aggregation that appropriately consider the performance gaps among individual methods and the performance dependence of each method on individual images. This paper discusses various data-driven approaches and finds that the image-dependent aggregation method works best. Specifically, our method uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for saliency aggregation that not only models the contribution from individual saliency map but also the interaction between neighboringpixels. To account for the dependence of aggregation on an individual image, our approach selects a subset of images similar to the input image from a training data set and trains the CRF aggregation model only using this subset instead of the whole training set. Our experiments on public saliency benchmarks show that our aggregation method outperforms each individual saliency method and is robust with the selection of aggregated methods.</p><p>5 0.7962603 <a title="451-lsi-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Salient_Object_Detection%3A_A_Discriminative_Regional_Feature_Integration_Approach.html">376 cvpr-2013-Salient Object Detection: A Discriminative Regional Feature Integration Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Jing Yuan, Wu Qiu, Eranga Ukwatta, Martin Rajchl, Xue-Cheng Tai, Aaron Fenster</p><p>Abstract: Segmenting 3D endfiring transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate images efficiently and accurately is of utmost importance for the planning and guiding 3D TRUS guided prostate biopsy. Poor image quality and imaging artifacts of 3D TRUS images often introduce a challenging task in computation to directly extract the 3D prostate surface. In this work, we propose a novel global optimization approach to delineate 3D prostate boundaries using its rotational resliced images around a specified axis, which properly enforces the inherent rotational symmetry of prostate shapes to jointly adjust a series of 2D slicewise segmentations in the global 3D sense. We show that the introduced challenging combinatorial optimization problem can be solved globally and exactly by means of convex relaxation. In this regard, we propose a novel coupled continuous max-flow model, which not only provides a powerful mathematical tool to analyze the proposed optimization problem but also amounts to a new and efficient duality-basedalgorithm. Ex- tensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-art methods in terms ofefficiency, accuracy, reliability and less user-interactions, and reduces the execution time by a factor of 100.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73196936 <a title="451-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Unsupervised_Salience_Learning_for_Person_Re-identification.html">451 cvpr-2013-Unsupervised Salience Learning for Person Re-identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui Zhao, Wanli Ouyang, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Human eyes can recognize person identities based on some small salient regions. However, such valuable salient information is often hidden when computing similarities of images with existing approaches. Moreover, many existing approaches learn discriminative features and handle drastic viewpoint change in a supervised way and require labeling new training data for a different pair of camera views. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective for person re-identification based on unsupervised salience learning. Distinctive features are extracted without requiring identity labels in the training procedure. First, we apply adjacency constrained patch matching to build dense correspondence between image pairs, which shows effectiveness in handling misalignment caused by large viewpoint and pose variations. Second, we learn human salience in an unsupervised manner. To improve the performance of person re-identification, human salience is incorporated in patch matching to find reliable and discriminative matched patches. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the widely used VIPeR dataset and ETHZ dataset.</p><p>3 0.69202328 <a title="451-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Modeling_Mutual_Visibility_Relationship_in_Pedestrian_Detection.html">288 cvpr-2013-Modeling Mutual Visibility Relationship in Pedestrian Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Wanli Ouyang, Xingyu Zeng, Xiaogang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting pedestrians in cluttered scenes is a challenging problem in computer vision. The difficulty is added when several pedestrians overlap in images and occlude each other. We observe, however, that the occlusion/visibility statuses of overlapping pedestrians provide useful mutual relationship for visibility estimation - the visibility estimation of one pedestrian facilitates the visibility estimation of another. In this paper, we propose a mutual visibility deep model that jointly estimates the visibility statuses of overlapping pedestrians. The visibility relationship among pedestrians is learned from the deep model for recognizing co-existing pedestrians. Experimental results show that the mutual visibility deep model effectively improves the pedestrian detection results. Compared with existing image-based pedestrian detection approaches, our approach has the lowest average miss rate on the CaltechTrain dataset, the Caltech-Test dataset and the ETHdataset. Including mutual visibility leads to 4% −8% improvements on mluudlitnipglem ubteunaclh vmiasibrki ditayta lesaedtss.</p><p>4 0.69133091 <a title="451-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>5 0.68687505 <a title="451-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Transfer_Sparse_Coding_for_Robust_Image_Representation.html">442 cvpr-2013-Transfer Sparse Coding for Robust Image Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mingsheng Long, Guiguang Ding, Jianmin Wang, Jiaguang Sun, Yuchen Guo, Philip S. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding learns a set of basis functions such that each input signal can be well approximated by a linear combination of just a few of the bases. It has attracted increasing interest due to its state-of-the-art performance in BoW based image representation. However, when labeled and unlabeled images are sampled from different distributions, they may be quantized into different visual words of the codebook and encoded with different representations, which may severely degrade classification performance. In this paper, we propose a Transfer Sparse Coding (TSC) approach to construct robust sparse representations for classifying cross-distribution images accurately. Specifically, we aim to minimize the distribution divergence between the labeled and unlabeled images, and incorporate this criterion into the objective function of sparse coding to make the new representations robust to the distribution difference. Experiments show that TSC can significantly outperform state-ofthe-art methods on three types of computer vision datasets.</p><p>6 0.67808735 <a title="451-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Hallucinated_Humans_as_the_Hidden_Context_for_Labeling_3D_Scenes.html">197 cvpr-2013-Hallucinated Humans as the Hidden Context for Labeling 3D Scenes</a></p>
