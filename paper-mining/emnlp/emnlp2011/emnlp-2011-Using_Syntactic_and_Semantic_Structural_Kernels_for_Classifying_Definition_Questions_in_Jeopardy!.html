<p>Author: Marco Dinarelli ; Sophie Rosset</p><p>Abstract: Reranking models have been successfully applied to many tasks of Natural Language Processing. However, there are two aspects of this approach that need a deeper investigation: (i) Assessment of hypotheses generated for reranking at classification phase: baseline models generate a list of hypotheses and these are used for reranking without any assessment; (ii) Detection of cases where reranking models provide a worst result: the best hypothesis provided by the reranking model is assumed to be always the best result. In some cases the reranking model provides an incorrect hypothesis while the baseline best hypothesis is correct, especially when baseline models are accurate. In this paper we propose solutions for these two aspects: (i) a semantic inconsistency metric to select possibly more correct n-best hypotheses, from a large set generated by an SLU basiline model. The selected hypotheses are reranked applying a state-of-the-art model based on Partial Tree Kernels, which encode SLU hypotheses in Support Vector Machines with complex structured features; (ii) finally, we apply a decision strategy, based on confidence values, to select the final hypothesis between the first ranked hypothesis provided by the baseline SLU model and the first ranked hypothesis provided by the re-ranker. We show the effectiveness of these solutions presenting comparative results obtained reranking hypotheses generated by a very accurate Conditional Random Field model. We evaluate our approach on the French MEDIA corpus. The results show significant improvements with respect to current state-of-the-art and previous 1104 Sophie Rosset LIMSI-CNRS B.P. 133, 91403 Orsay Cedex France ro s set @ l ims i fr . re-ranking models.</p><p>4 0.10775779 <a title="147-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>
<p>Author: Marjorie Freedman ; Lance Ramshaw ; Elizabeth Boschee ; Ryan Gabbard ; Gary Kratkiewicz ; Nicolas Ward ; Ralph Weischedel</p><p>Abstract: We report on empirical results in extreme extraction. It is extreme in that (1) from receipt of the ontology specifying the target concepts and relations, development is limited to one week and that (2) relatively little training data is assumed. We are able to surpass human recall and achieve an F1 of 0.5 1 on a question-answering task with less than 50 hours of effort using a hybrid approach that mixes active learning, bootstrapping, and limited (5 hours) manual rule writing. We compare the performance of three systems: extraction with handwritten rules, bootstrapped extraction, and a combination. We show that while the recall of the handwritten rules surpasses that of the learned system, the learned system is able to improve the overall recall and F1.</p><p>5 0.075867712 <a title="147-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Extraction_with_Relation_Topics.html">114 emnlp-2011-Relation Extraction with Relation Topics</a></p>
<p>Author: Chang Wang ; James Fan ; Aditya Kalyanpur ; David Gondek</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to the semantic relation detection problem. Instead of relying only on the training instances for a new relation, we leverage the knowledge learned from previously trained relation detectors. Specifically, we detect a new semantic relation by projecting the new relation’s training instances onto a lower dimension topic space constructed from existing relation detectors through a three step process. First, we construct a large relation repository of more than 7,000 relations from Wikipedia. Second, we construct a set of non-redundant relation topics defined at multiple scales from the relation repository to characterize the existing relations. Similar to the topics defined over words, each relation topic is an interpretable multinomial distribution over the existing relations. Third, we integrate the relation topics in a kernel function, and use it together with SVM to construct detectors for new relations. The experimental results on Wikipedia and ACE data have confirmed that backgroundknowledge-based topics generated from the Wikipedia relation repository can significantly improve the performance over the state-of-theart relation detection approaches.</p><p>6 0.066763468 <a title="147-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Learning_the_Information_Status_of_Noun_Phrases_in_Spoken_Dialogues.html">84 emnlp-2011-Learning the Information Status of Noun Phrases in Spoken Dialogues</a></p>

<p>Author: Altaf Rahman ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: An entity in a dialogue may be old, new, or mediated/inferrable with respect to the hearer’s beliefs. Knowing the information status of the entities participating in a dialogue can therefore facilitate its interpretation. We address the under-investigated problem of automatically determining the information status of discourse entities. Specifically, we extend Nissim’s (2006) machine learning approach to information-status determination with lexical and structured features, and exploit learned knowledge of the information status of each discourse entity for coreference resolution. Experimental results on a set of Switchboard dialogues reveal that (1) incorporating our proposed features into Nissim’s feature set enables our system to achieve stateof-the-art performance on information-status classification, and (2) the resulting information can be used to improve the performance of learning-based coreference resolvers.</p><p>6 0.25084341 <a title="147-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Relation_Extraction_with_Relation_Topics.html">114 emnlp-2011-Relation Extraction with Relation Topics</a></p>

Our experiments measuring their impact on Watson show enhancements in QA accuracy and a consequent increase in the amount of money earned in game-based evaluation.</p><p>2 0.60284191 <a title="147-lda-2" href="./emnlp-2011-Structured_Lexical_Similarity_via_Convolution_Kernels_on_Dependency_Trees.html">127 emnlp-2011-Structured Lexical Similarity via Convolution Kernels on Dependency Trees</a></p>

In this paper, we study convolution dependency tree kernels for automatic engineering of syntactic and semantic patterns exploiting lexical similarities. We define efficient and powerful kernels for measuring the similarity between dependency structures, whose surface forms of the lexical nodes are in part or completely different. The experiments with such kernels for question classification show an unprecedented results, e.g. 41% of error reduction of the former state-of-the-art. Additionally, semantic role classification confirms the benefit of semantic smoothing for dependency kernels.</p><p>3 0.580486 <a title="147-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2011-Simple_Effective_Decipherment_via_Combinatorial_Optimization.html">122 emnlp-2011-Simple Effective Decipherment via Combinatorial Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple objective function that when optimized yields accurate solutions to both decipherment and cognate pair identification problems. The objective simultaneously scores a matching between two alphabets and a matching between two lexicons, each in a different language. We introduce a simple coordinate descent procedure that efficiently finds effective solutions to the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. Our system requires only a list of words in both languages as input, yet it competes with and surpasses several state-of-the-art systems that are both substantially more complex and make use of more information.</p><p>4 0.49543709 <a title="147-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2011-Soft_Dependency_Constraints_for_Reordering_in_Hierarchical_Phrase-Based_Translation.html">123 emnlp-2011-Soft Dependency Constraints for Reordering in Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Gao ; Philipp Koehn ; Alexandra Birch</p><p>Abstract: Long-distance reordering remains one of the biggest challenges facing machine translation. We derive soft constraints from the source dependency parsing to directly address the reordering problem for the hierarchical phrasebased model. Our approach significantly improves Chinese–English machine translation on a large-scale task by 0.84 BLEU points on average. Moreover, when we switch the tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore which promotes reordering, we observe total improvements of 1.21 BLEU, 1.30 LRscore and 3.36 TER over the baseline. On average our approach improves reordering precision and recall by 6.9 and 0.3 absolute points, respectively, and is found to be especially effective for long-distance reodering.</p><p>5 0.49456713 <a title="147-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2011-Linking_Entities_to_a_Knowledge_Base_with_Query_Expansion.html">90 emnlp-2011-Linking Entities to a Knowledge Base with Query Expansion</a></p>
<p>Author: Swapna Gottipati ; Jing Jiang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to entity linking based on a statistical language model-based information retrieval with query expansion. We use both local contexts and global world knowledge to expand query language models. We place a strong emphasis on named entities in the local contexts and explore a positional language model to weigh them differently based on their distances to the query. Our experiments on the TAC-KBP 2010 data show that incorporating such contextual information indeed aids in disambiguating the named entities and consistently improves the entity linking performance. Compared with the official results from KBP 2010 participants, our system shows competitive performance.</p><p>6 0.49361944 <a title="147-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2011-Extreme_Extraction_-_Machine_Reading_in_a_Week.html">57 emnlp-2011-Extreme Extraction - Machine Reading in a Week</a></p>
