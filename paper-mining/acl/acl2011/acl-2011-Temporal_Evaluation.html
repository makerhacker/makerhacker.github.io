<p>Author: Oleksandr Kolomiyets ; Steven Bethard ; Marie-Francine Moens</p><p>Abstract: We explore a semi-supervised approach for improving the portability of time expression recognition to non-newswire domains: we generate additional training examples by substituting temporal expression words with potential synonyms. We explore using synonyms both from WordNet and from the Latent Words Language Model (LWLM), which predicts synonyms in context using an unsupervised approach. We evaluate a state-of-the-art time expression recognition system trained both with and without the additional training examples using data from TempEval 2010, Reuters and Wikipedia. We find that the LWLM provides substantial improvements on the Reuters corpus, and smaller improvements on the Wikipedia corpus. We find that WordNet alone never improves performance, though intersecting the examples from the LWLM and WordNet provides more stable results for Wikipedia. 1</p><p>5 0.082180023 <a title="294-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2011-Temporal_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_Dependency_Parsing.html">295 acl-2011-Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Dependency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikhil Garg ; James Henderson</p><p>Abstract: We propose a generative model based on Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machines for transition based dependency parsing. The parse tree is built incrementally using a shiftreduce parse and an RBM is used to model each decision step. The RBM at the current time step induces latent features with the help of temporal connections to the relevant previous steps which provide context information. Our parser achieves labeled and unlabeled attachment scores of 88.72% and 91.65% respectively, which compare well with similar previous models and the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.051387757 <a title="294-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2011-Search_in_the_Lost_Sense_of_%22Query%22%3A_Question_Formulation_in_Web_Search_Queries_and_its_Temporal_Changes.html">271 acl-2011-Search in the Lost Sense of "Query": Question Formulation in Web Search Queries and its Temporal Changes</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Li ; Eric Gaussier ; Akiko Aizawa</p><p>Abstract: We study in this paper the problem of enhancing the comparability of bilingual corpora in order to improve the quality of bilingual lexicons extracted from comparable corpora. We introduce a clustering-based approach for enhancing corpus comparability which exploits the homogeneity feature of the corpus, and finally preserves most of the vocabulary of the original corpus. Our experiments illustrate the well-foundedness of this method and show that the bilingual lexicons obtained from the homogeneous corpus are of better quality than the lexicons obtained with previous approaches.</p><p>5 0.32501528 <a title="294-lsi-5" href="./acl-2011-Automatically_Evaluating_Text_Coherence_Using_Discourse_Relations.html">53 acl-2011-Automatically Evaluating Text Coherence Using Discourse Relations</a></p>
<p>Author: Ziheng Lin ; Hwee Tou Ng ; Min-Yen Kan</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel model to represent and assess the discourse coherence of text. Our model assumes that coherent text implicitly favors certain types of discourse relation transitions. We implement this model and apply it towards the text ordering ranking task, which aims to discern an original text from a permuted ordering of its sentences. The experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to significantly outperform the state-ofthe-art coherence model by Barzilay and Lapata (2005), reducing the error rate of the previous approach by an average of 29% over three data sets against human upperbounds. We further show that our model is synergistic with the previous approach, demonstrating an error reduction of 73% when the features from both models are combined for the task.</p><p>6 0.29931629 <a title="294-lsi-6" href="./acl-2011-An_Interface_for_Rapid_Natural_Language_Processing_Development_in_UIMA.html">42 acl-2011-An Interface for Rapid Natural Language Processing Development in UIMA</a></p>

<p>Author: Edward Benson ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for record extraction from social streams such as Twitter. Unlike typical extraction setups, these environments are characterized by short, one sentence messages with heavily colloquial speech. To further complicate matters, individual messages may not express the full relation to be uncovered, as is often assumed in extraction tasks. We develop a graphical model that addresses these problems by learning a latent set of records and a record-message alignment simultaneously; the output of our model is a set of canonical records, the values of which are consistent with aligned messages. We demonstrate that our approach is able to accurately induce event records from Twitter messages, evaluated against events from a local city guide. Our method achieves significant error reduction over baseline methods.1</p><p>3 0.32804754 <a title="294-lda-3" href="./acl-2011-A_Hierarchical_Model_of_Web_Summaries.html">14 acl-2011-A Hierarchical Model of Web Summaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Petinot ; Kathleen McKeown ; Kapil Thadani</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the relevance of hierarchical topic models to represent the content of Web gists. We focus our attention on DMOZ, a popular Web directory, and propose two algorithms to infer such a model from its manually-curated hierarchy of categories. Our first approach, based on information-theoretic grounds, uses an algorithm similar to recursive feature selection. Our second approach is fully Bayesian and derived from the more general model, hierarchical LDA. We evaluate the performance of both models against a flat 1-gram baseline and show improvements in terms of perplexity over held-out data.</p><p>4 0.32597816 <a title="294-lda-4" href="./acl-2011-Social_Network_Extraction_from_Texts%3A_A_Thesis_Proposal.html">286 acl-2011-Social Network Extraction from Texts: A Thesis Proposal</a></p>
<p>Author: Apoorv Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: In my thesis, Ipropose to build a system that would enable extraction of social interactions from texts. To date Ihave defined a comprehensive set of social events and built a preliminary system that extracts social events from news articles. Iplan to improve the performance of my current system by incorporating semantic information. Using domain adaptation techniques, Ipropose to apply my system to a wide range of genres. By extracting linguistic constructs relevant to social interactions, I will be able to empirically analyze different kinds of linguistic constructs that people use to express social interactions. Lastly, I will attempt to make convolution kernels more scalable and interpretable.</p><p>5 0.31824055 <a title="294-lda-5" href="./acl-2011-IMASS%3A_An_Intelligent_Microblog_Analysis_and_Summarization_System.html">156 acl-2011-IMASS: An Intelligent Microblog Analysis and Summarization System</a></p>
<p>Author: Jui-Yu Weng ; Cheng-Lun Yang ; Bo-Nian Chen ; Yen-Kai Wang ; Shou-De Lin</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a system to summarize a Microblog post and its responses with the goal to provide readers a more constructive and concise set of information for efficient digestion. We introduce a novel two-phase summarization scheme. In the first phase, the post plus its responses are classified into four categories based on the intention, interrogation, sharing, discussion and chat. For each type of post, in the second phase, we exploit different strategies, including opinion analysis, response pair identification, and response relevancy detection, to summarize and highlight critical information to display. This system provides an alternative thinking about machinesummarization: by utilizing AI approaches, computers are capable of constructing deeper and more user-friendly abstraction. 1</p><p>6 0.31733456 <a title="294-lda-6" href="./acl-2011-Does_Size_Matter_-_How_Much_Data_is_Required_to_Train_a_REG_Algorithm%3F.html">102 acl-2011-Does Size Matter - How Much Data is Required to Train a REG Algorithm?</a></p>
