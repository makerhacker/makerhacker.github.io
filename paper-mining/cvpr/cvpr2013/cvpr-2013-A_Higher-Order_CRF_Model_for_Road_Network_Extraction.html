<p>Author: Dengfeng Chai, Wolfgang Förstner, Florent Lafarge</p><p>Abstract: The automatic extraction of line-networks from images is a well-known computer vision issue. Appearance and shape considerations have been deeply explored in the literature to improve accuracy in presence of occlusions, shadows, and a wide variety of irrelevant objects. However most existing works have ignored the structural aspect of the problem. We present an original method which provides structurally-coherent solutions. Contrary to the pixelbased and object-based methods, our result is a graph in which each node represents either a connection or an ending in the line-network. Based on stochastic geometry, we develop a new family of point processes consisting in sampling junction-points in the input image by using a Monte Carlo mechanism. The quality of a configuration is measured by a probability density which takes into account both image consistency and shape priors. Our experiments on a variety of problems illustrate the potential of our approach in terms of accuracy, flexibility and efficiency.</p><p>3 0.18617208 <a title="13-tfidf-3" href="./cvpr-2013-Improving_an_Object_Detector_and_Extracting_Regions_Using_Superpixels.html">217 cvpr-2013-Improving an Object Detector and Extracting Regions Using Superpixels</a></p>
<p>Author: Guang Shu, Afshin Dehghan, Mubarak Shah</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to improve the detection performance of a generic detector when it is applied to a particular video. The performance of offline-trained objects detectors are usually degraded in unconstrained video environments due to variant illuminations, backgrounds and camera viewpoints. Moreover, most object detectors are trained using Haar-like features or gradient features but ignore video specificfeatures like consistent colorpatterns. In our approach, we apply a Superpixel-based Bag-of-Words (BoW) model to iteratively refine the output of a generic detector. Compared to other related work, our method builds a video-specific detector using superpixels, hence it can handle the problem of appearance variation. Most importantly, using Conditional Random Field (CRF) along with our super pixel-based BoW model, we develop and algorithm to segment the object from the background . Therefore our method generates an output of the exact object regions instead of the bounding boxes generated by most detectors. In general, our method takes detection bounding boxes of a generic detector as input and generates the detection output with higher average precision and precise object regions. The experiments on four recent datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and significantly improves the state-of-art detector by 5-16% in average precision.</p><p>4 0.18300313 <a title="13-tfidf-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Nonparametric_Scene_Parsing_with_Adaptive_Feature_Relevance_and_Semantic_Context.html">309 cvpr-2013-Nonparametric Scene Parsing with Adaptive Feature Relevance and Semantic Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Gautam Singh, Jana Kosecka</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a nonparametric approach to semantic parsing using small patches and simple gradient, color and location features. We learn the relevance of individual feature channels at test time using a locally adaptive distance metric. To further improve the accuracy of the nonparametric approach, we examine the importance of the retrieval set used to compute the nearest neighbours using a novel semantic descriptor to retrieve better candidates. The approach is validated by experiments on several datasets used for semantic parsing demonstrating the superiority of the method compared to the state of art approaches.</p><p>5 0.18199742 <a title="13-tfidf-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Whitened_Expectation_Propagation%3A_Non-Lambertian_Shape_from_Shading_and_Shadow.html">466 cvpr-2013-Whitened Expectation Propagation: Non-Lambertian Shape from Shading and Shadow</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Potetz, Mohammadreza Hajiarbabi</p><p>Abstract: For problems over continuous random variables, MRFs with large cliques pose a challenge in probabilistic inference. Difficulties in performing optimization efficiently have limited the probabilistic models explored in computer vision and other fields. One inference technique that handles large cliques well is Expectation Propagation. EP offers run times independent of clique size, which instead depend only on the rank, or intrinsic dimensionality, of potentials. This property would be highly advantageous in computer vision. Unfortunately, for grid-shaped models common in vision, traditional Gaussian EP requires quadratic space and cubic time in the number of pixels. Here, we propose a variation of EP that exploits regularities in natural scene statistics to achieve run times that are linear in both number of pixels and clique size. We test these methods on shape from shading, and we demonstrate strong performance not only for Lambertian surfaces, but also on arbitrary surface reflectance and lighting arrangements, which requires highly non-Gaussian potentials. Finally, we use large, non-local cliques to exploit cast shadow, which is traditionally ignored in shape from shading.</p><p>6 0.14530224 <a title="13-tfidf-6" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Video_Representation_Using_Temporal_Superpixels.html">29 cvpr-2013-A Video Representation Using Temporal Superpixels</a></p>

This is in contrast to earlier approaches that usually assume a tree topology for the networks. At the heart of our method is an Integer Programming formulation that allows us to find the global optimum of an objective function designed to allow cycles but penalize spurious junctions and early terminations.

<p>Author: Marcus A. Brubaker, Andreas Geiger, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose an affordable solution to selflocalization, which utilizes visual odometry and road maps as the only inputs. To this end, we present a probabilistic model as well as an efficient approximate inference algorithm, which is able to utilize distributed computation to meet the real-time requirements of autonomous systems. Because of the probabilistic nature of the model we are able to cope with uncertainty due to noisy visual odometry and inherent ambiguities in the map (e.g., in a Manhattan world). By exploiting freely available, community developed maps and visual odometry measurements, we are able to localize a vehicle up to 3m after only a few seconds of driving on maps which contain more than 2,150km of drivable roads.</p><p>6 0.42783859 <a title="13-lsi-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Graph-Based_Optimization_with_Tubularity_Markov_Tree_for_3D_Vessel_Segmentation.html">190 cvpr-2013-Graph-Based Optimization with Tubularity Markov Tree for 3D Vessel Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuichi Takeda, Shinsaku Hiura, Kosuke Sato</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel depth measurement method by fusing depth from defocus (DFD) and stereo. One of the problems of passive stereo method is the difficulty of finding correct correspondence between images when an object has a repetitive pattern or edges parallel to the epipolar line. On the other hand, the accuracy of DFD method is inherently limited by the effective diameter of the lens. Therefore, we propose the fusion of stereo method and DFD by giving different focus distances for left and right cameras of a stereo camera with coded apertures. Two types of depth cues, defocus and disparity, are naturally integrated by the magnification and phase shift of a single point spread function (PSF) per camera. In this paper we give the proof of the proportional relationship between the diameter of defocus and disparity which makes the calibration easy. We also show the outstanding performance of our method which has both advantages of two depth cues through simulation and actual experiments.</p><p>2 0.84696347 <a title="13-lda-2" href="./cvpr-2013-Accurate_and_Robust_Registration_of_Nonrigid_Surface_Using_Hierarchical_Statistical_Shape_Model.html">31 cvpr-2013-Accurate and Robust Registration of Nonrigid Surface Using Hierarchical Statistical Shape Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Hidekata Hontani, Yuto Tsunekawa, Yoshihide Sawada</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new non-rigid robust registration method that registers a point distribution model (PDM) of a surface to given 3D images. The contributions of the paper are (1) a new hierarchical statistical shape model (SSM) of the surface that has better generalization ability is introduced, (2) the registration algorithm of the hierarchical SSM that can estimate the marginal posterior distribution of the surface location is proposed, and (3) the registration performance is improved by (3-1) robustly registering each local shape of the surface with the sparsity regularization and by (3-2) referring to the appearance between the neighboring model points in the likelihood computation. The SSM of a liver was constructed from a set of clinical CT images, and the performance of the proposed method was evaluated. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed some existing methods that use non-hierarchical SSMs.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.84445417 <a title="13-lda-3" href="./cvpr-2013-A_Higher-Order_CRF_Model_for_Road_Network_Extraction.html">13 cvpr-2013-A Higher-Order CRF Model for Road Network Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Jan D. Wegner, Javier A. Montoya-Zegarra, Konrad Schindler</p><p>Abstract: The aim of this work is to extract the road network from aerial images. What makes the problem challenging is the complex structure of the prior: roads form a connected network of smooth, thin segments which meet at junctions and crossings. This type of a-priori knowledge is more difficult to turn into a tractable model than standard smoothness or co-occurrence assumptions. We develop a novel CRF formulation for road labeling, in which the prior is represented by higher-order cliques that connect sets of superpixels along straight line segments. These long-range cliques have asymmetric PN-potentials, which express a preference to assign all rather than just some of their constituent superpixels to the road class. Thus, the road likelihood is amplified for thin chains of superpixels, while the CRF is still amenable to optimization with graph cuts. Since the number of such cliques of arbitrary length is huge, we furthermorepropose a sampling scheme which concentrates on those cliques which are most relevant for the optimization. In experiments on two different databases the model significantly improves both the per-pixel accuracy and the topological correctness of the extracted roads, and outper- forms both a simple smoothness prior and heuristic rulebased road completion.</p><p>4 0.82680857 <a title="13-lda-4" href="./cvpr-2013-Optimal_Geometric_Fitting_under_the_Truncated_L2-Norm.html">317 cvpr-2013-Optimal Geometric Fitting under the Truncated L2-Norm</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik Ask, Olof Enqvist, Fredrik Kahl</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with model fitting in the presence of noise and outliers. Previously it has been shown that the number of outliers can be minimized with polynomial complexity in the number of measurements. This paper improves on these results in two ways. First, it is shown that for a large class of problems, the statistically more desirable truncated L2-norm can be optimized with the same complexity. Then, with the same methodology, it is shown how to transform multi-model fitting into a purely combinatorial problem—with worst-case complexity that is polynomial in the number of measurements, though exponential in the number of models. We apply our framework to a series of hard registration and stitching problems demonstrating that the approach is not only of theoretical interest. It gives a practical method for simultaneously dealing with measurement noise and large amounts of outliers for fitting problems with lowdimensional models.</p><p>5 0.82622695 <a title="13-lda-5" href="./cvpr-2013-Fast_Energy_Minimization_Using_Learned_State_Filters.html">165 cvpr-2013-Fast Energy Minimization Using Learned State Filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van_Gool, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise discrete energies defined over graphs are ubiquitous in computer vision. Many algorithms have been proposed to minimize such energies, often concentrating on sparse graph topologies or specialized classes of pairwise potentials. However, when the graph is fully connected and the pairwise potentials are arbitrary, the complexity of even approximate minimization algorithms such as TRW-S grows quadratically both in the number of nodes and in the number of states a node can take. Moreover, recent applications are using more and more computationally expensive pairwise potentials. These factors make it very hard to employ fully connected models. In this paper we propose a novel, generic algorithm to approximately minimize any discrete pairwise energy function. Our method exploits tractable sub-energies to filter the domain of the function. The parameters of the filter are learnt from instances of the same class of energies with good candidate solutions. Compared to existing methods, it efficiently handles fully connected graphs, with many states per node, and arbitrary pairwise potentials, which might be expensive to compute. We demonstrate experimentally on two applications that our algorithm is much more efficient than other generic minimization algorithms such as TRW-S, while returning essentially identical solutions.</p><p>6 0.82576919 <a title="13-lda-6" href="./cvpr-2013-Robust_Monocular_Epipolar_Flow_Estimation.html">362 cvpr-2013-Robust Monocular Epipolar Flow Estimation</a></p>
