<p>Author: Joseph Reisinger ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: We introduce tiered clustering, a mixture model capable of accounting for varying degrees of shared (context-independent) feature structure, and demonstrate its applicability to inferring distributed representations of word meaning. Common tasks in lexical semantics such as word relatedness or selectional preference can benefit from modeling such structure: Polysemous word usage is often governed by some common background metaphoric usage (e.g. the senses of line or run), and likewise modeling the selectional preference of verbs relies on identifying commonalities shared by their typical arguments. Tiered clustering can also be viewed as a form of soft feature selection, where features that do not contribute meaningfully to the clustering can be excluded. We demonstrate the applicability of tiered clustering, highlighting particular cases where modeling shared structure is beneficial and where it can be detrimental.</p><p>3 0.26104742 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Simple_Type-Level_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">97 emnlp-2010-Simple Type-Level Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoong Keok Lee ; Aria Haghighi ; Regina Barzilay</p><p>Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tag distributions are known to exhibit sparsity a word is likely to take a single predominant tag in a corpus. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating this sparsity constraint improves tagging accuracy. However, in existing systems, this expansion come with a steep increase in model complexity. This paper proposes a simple and effective tagging method that directly models tag sparsity and other distributional properties of valid POS tag assignments. In addition, this formulation results in a dramatic reduction in the number of model parameters thereby, enabling unusually rapid training. Our experiments consistently demonstrate that this model architecture yields substantial performance gains over more complex tagging — counterparts. On several languages, we report performance exceeding that of more complex state-of-the art systems.1</p><p>4 0.23116694 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Latent-Descriptor_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_POS_Induction.html">71 emnlp-2010-Latent-Descriptor Clustering for Unsupervised POS Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Lamar ; Yariv Maron ; Elie Bienenstock</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to distributionalonly, fully unsupervised, POS tagging, based on an adaptation of the EM algorithm for the estimation of a Gaussian mixture. In this approach, which we call Latent-Descriptor Clustering (LDC), word types are clustered using a series of progressively more informative descriptor vectors. These descriptors, which are computed from the immediate left and right context of each word in the corpus, are updated based on the previous state of the cluster assignments. The LDC algorithm is simple and intuitive. Using standard evaluation criteria for unsupervised POS tagging, LDC shows a substantial improvement in performance over state-of-the-art methods, along with a several-fold reduction in computational cost.</p><p>5 0.21732573 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Longhua Qian ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Seed sampling is critical in semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes a clusteringbased stratified seed sampling approach to semi-supervised learning. First, various clustering algorithms are explored to partition the unlabeled instances into different strata with each stratum represented by a center. Then, diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling is adopted to choose the center and additional instances from each stratum to form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate. Finally, the labeled seed set is fed into a bootstrapping procedure as the initial labeled data. We systematically evaluate our stratified bootstrapping approach in the semantic relation classification subtask of the ACE RDC (Relation Detection and Classification) task. In particular, we compare various clustering algorithms on the stratified bootstrapping performance. Experimental results on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus show that our clusteringbased stratified bootstrapping approach achieves the best F1-score of 75.9 on the subtask of semantic relation classification, approaching the one with golden clustering.</p><p>6 0.2057752 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Crouching_Dirichlet%2C_Hidden_Markov_Model%3A_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging_with_Context_Local_Tag_Generation.html">34 emnlp-2010-Crouching Dirichlet, Hidden Markov Model: Unsupervised POS Tagging with Context Local Tag Generation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Dredze ; Aren Jansen ; Glen Coppersmith ; Ken Church</p><p>Abstract: There is considerable interest in interdisciplinary combinations of automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine learning, natural language processing, text classification and information retrieval. Many of these boxes, especially ASR, are often based on considerable linguistic resources. We would like to be able to process spoken documents with few (if any) resources. Moreover, connecting black boxes in series tends to multiply errors, especially when the key terms are out-ofvocabulary (OOV). The proposed alternative applies text processing directly to the speech without a dependency on ASR. The method finds long (∼ 1 sec) repetitions in speech, fainndd scl luostnegrs t∼he 1m sinecto) pseudo-terms (roughly phrases). Document clustering and classification work surprisingly well on pseudoterms; performance on a Switchboard task approaches a baseline using gold standard man- ual transcriptions.</p><p>6 0.60453147 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Simple_Type-Level_Unsupervised_POS_Tagging.html">97 emnlp-2010-Simple Type-Level Unsupervised POS Tagging</a></p>

<p>Author: Hai Son Le ; Alexandre Allauzen ; Guillaume Wisniewski ; Francois Yvon</p><p>Abstract: Using multi-layer neural networks to estimate the probabilities of word sequences is a promising research area in statistical language modeling, with applications in speech recognition and statistical machine translation. However, training such models for large vocabulary tasks is computationally challenging which does not scale easily to the huge corpora that are nowadays available. In this work, we study the performance and behavior of two neural statistical language models so as to highlight some important caveats of the classical training algorithms. The induced word embeddings for extreme cases are also analysed, thus providing insight into the convergence issues. A new initialization scheme and new training techniques are then introduced. These methods are shown to greatly reduce the training time and to significantly improve performance, both in terms ofperplexity and on a large-scale translation task.</p><p>3 0.96719241 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based_Stratified_Seed_Sampling_for_Semi-Supervised_Relation_Classification.html">27 emnlp-2010-Clustering-Based Stratified Seed Sampling for Semi-Supervised Relation Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Longhua Qian ; Guodong Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Seed sampling is critical in semi-supervised learning. This paper proposes a clusteringbased stratified seed sampling approach to semi-supervised learning. First, various clustering algorithms are explored to partition the unlabeled instances into different strata with each stratum represented by a center. Then, diversity-motivated intra-stratum sampling is adopted to choose the center and additional instances from each stratum to form the unlabeled seed set for an oracle to annotate. Finally, the labeled seed set is fed into a bootstrapping procedure as the initial labeled data. We systematically evaluate our stratified bootstrapping approach in the semantic relation classification subtask of the ACE RDC (Relation Detection and Classification) task. In particular, we compare various clustering algorithms on the stratified bootstrapping performance. Experimental results on the ACE RDC 2004 corpus show that our clusteringbased stratified bootstrapping approach achieves the best F1-score of 75.9 on the subtask of semantic relation classification, approaching the one with golden clustering.</p><p>4 0.96388727 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./emnlp-2010-Jointly_Modeling_Aspects_and_Opinions_with_a_MaxEnt-LDA_Hybrid.html">70 emnlp-2010-Jointly Modeling Aspects and Opinions with a MaxEnt-LDA Hybrid</a></p>
<p>Author: Xin Zhao ; Jing Jiang ; Hongfei Yan ; Xiaoming Li</p><p>Abstract: Discovering and summarizing opinions from online reviews is an important and challenging task. A commonly-adopted framework generates structured review summaries with aspects and opinions. Recently topic models have been used to identify meaningful review aspects, but existing topic models do not identify aspect-specific opinion words. In this paper, we propose a MaxEnt-LDA hybrid model to jointly discover both aspects and aspect-specific opinion words. We show that with a relatively small amount of training data, our model can effectively identify aspect and opinion words simultaneously. We also demonstrate the domain adaptability of our model.</p><p>5 0.96117043 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./emnlp-2010-Extracting_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Single_and_Cross-Domain_Setting_with_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">49 emnlp-2010-Extracting Opinion Targets in a Single and Cross-Domain Setting with Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Niklas Jakob ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the opinion target extraction as part of the opinion mining task. We model the problem as an information extraction task, which we address based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). As a baseline we employ the supervised algorithm by Zhuang et al. (2006), which represents the state-of-the-art on the employed data. We evaluate the algorithms comprehensively on datasets from four different domains annotated with individual opinion target instances on a sentence level. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our CRF-based approach and the baseline in a single- and cross-domain opinion target extraction setting. Our CRF-based approach improves the performance by 0.077, 0.126, 0.071 and 0. 178 regarding F-Measure in the single-domain extraction in the four domains. In the crossdomain setting our approach improves the performance by 0.409, 0.242, 0.294 and 0.343 regarding F-Measure over the baseline.</p><p>6 0.95551419 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./emnlp-2010-Enhancing_Mention_Detection_Using_Projection_via_Aligned_Corpora.html">44 emnlp-2010-Enhancing Mention Detection Using Projection via Aligned Corpora</a></p>
