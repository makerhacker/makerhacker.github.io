really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving
for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage
medium. Manyquality products have built on this model. Even if the vision
isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition,
which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:Disk-oriented approaches to
online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-
fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in
disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and
bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems
are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity
servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage
with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access
latency. T</p><p>5 0.11243584 <a title="742-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ebay[1]Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :- very simple
architecture- based on perl- no database, for data persistence they used plain
filesBecause of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so
V2 (clever name) was born:- replaced perl with C/C++- started using a database
in a master-slave configuration- C++ back-end- XSLT front-endAny request will
lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform
that into html.*pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was
cutting-edge back then*breakThat hold out pretty well for a while but in the
late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.They started having some
trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:- based on
java- search engine still used C++- proof that relational databases can scale
(aggressive caching)- developed a messaging layer for making a lot of
asyncronious calls, they actually ended up being sued because of the delay in
which images ap</p><p>6 0.11206616 <a title="742-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Scalability_Best_Practices%3A_Lessons_from_eBay.html">425 high scalability-2008-10-22-Scalability Best Practices: Lessons from eBay</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At eBay, one of the primary architectural forces we contend with every day is
scalability. It colors and drives every architectural and design decision we
make. With hundreds of millions of users worldwide, over two billion page
views a day, and petabytes of data in our systems, this is not a choice - it
is a necessity.In a scalable architecture, resource usage should increase
linearly (or better) with load, where load may be measured in user traffic,
data volume, etc. Where performance is about the resource usage associated
with a single unit of work, scalability is about how resource usage changes as
units of work grow in number or size. Said another way, scalability is the
shape of the price-performance curve, as opposed to its value at one point in
that curve.There are many facets to scalability - transactional, operational,
development effort. In this article, I will outline several of the key best
practices we have learned over time to scale the transactional throughput of a

<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88253915 <a title="742-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-17-10_eBay_Secrets_for_Planet_Wide_Scaling.html">742 high scalability-2009-11-17-10 eBay Secrets for Planet Wide Scaling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You don't even have to make a bid, Randy Shoup, an eBay Distinguished
Architect, gives thispresentationon how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done
a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of
this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more
about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a
particular technology stack.Impressive StatsIn case you weren't sure, eBay is
big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...Over 89 million active
users worldwide190 million items for sale in 50,000 categoriesOver 8 billion
URL requests per dayHundreds of new features per quarterRoughly 10% of items
are listed or ended every dayIn 39 countries and 10 languages24x7x36570

<p>Introduction: With the explosive growth of the Internet, increasing complexity of user
requirements, and wide choice of hardware, operating systems, and middleware,
IT executives are facing new challenges in their application infrastructures.
Rapid expansion of the application tier has resulted in significant cost and
