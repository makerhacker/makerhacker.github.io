<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>6 0.1756372 <a title="17-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Blog%3A_MySQL_Performance_Blog_-_Everything_about_MySQL_Performance._.html">15 high scalability-2007-07-16-Blog: MySQL Performance Blog - Everything about MySQL Performance. </a></p>

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>5 0.89071971 <a title="17-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-29-Event%3A_MySQL_Conference_%26_Expo_2009.html">504 high scalability-2009-01-29-Event: MySQL Conference & Expo 2009</a></p>

filling out a form of some kind, but it's a short, decent introduction to

<p>Introduction: Using this strategy, Valyala, a commenter onAre Long VM Instance Spin-Up Times
In The Cloud Costing You Money?, was able to reduce their GAE application
start-up times from 15 seconds down to to 1.5 seconds:Spin-up time for newly
added Google AppEngine instances can be reduced using initial state caching.
Usually the majority of spin-up time for the newly created GAE instance is
spent in the pre-populating of the initial state, which is created from many
data pieces loaded from slow data sources such as GAE's datastore. If the
initial state is identical among GAE instances, then the entire state can be
serialized and stored in a shared memory (either in the memcache or in the
datastore) by the first created instance, so newly created instances could
load and quickly unserialize the state from a single blob loaded from shared
memory instead of spending a lot of time for creation of the state from
multiple data pieces loaded from the datastore.I reduced spin-up time for new
instances of</p><p>3 0.92664361 <a title="17-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-Site_Moves_from_PHP_to_Facebook%27s_HipHop%2C_Now_Pages_Load_in_.6_Seconds_Instead_of_Five.html">1561 high scalability-2013-12-09-Site Moves from PHP to Facebook's HipHop, Now Pages Load in .6 Seconds Instead of Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you code in PHP have you ever wondered about moving to Facebook'sHipHop JIT
Virtual Machine for PHP? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in
web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared
to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really
drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?To answer questions like
this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:Adventures
in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP by
Yermo Lamers.Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He
took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and
business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the
same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think
it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow. PHP's slow string
handling makes dynamically evaluating a description template for each page</p><p>4 0.9253459 <a title="17-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-20-Strategy%3A_Consider_When_a_Service_Starts_Billing_in_Your_Algorithm_Cost.html">862 high scalability-2010-07-20-Strategy: Consider When a Service Starts Billing in Your Algorithm Cost</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At Monday'sCloud Computing Meetup,Paco Nathangave an excellentGetting Started
on Hadooptalk (slides). I found one of Paco's strategies particularly
interesting: consider when a service starts charging in cost calculations.
Depending on your use case it may be cheaper to go with a more expensive
service that charges only for work accomplished rather than charging for both
work + startup time.The example is comparing the cost of running Hadoop on AWS
yourself versus using Amazon's prepackaged Hadoop service,Elastic
MapReduce(EMR). The thought may have gone through your mind as it did mine
that it doesn't necessarily make sense to use Amazon's Hadoop service. Why pay
a premium for EMR when Hadoop will run directly on AWS?One reason is that
Amazon has made significant changes to Hadoop to make it run more efficiently
and easily on AWS. The other more surprising reason is cost.When starting a
500 node Hadoop cluster, for example, you have to wait for all the nodes to
start and join the clus</p><p>5 0.92506713 <a title="17-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-The_Implications_of_Punctuated_Scalabilium_for_Website_Architecture.html">533 high scalability-2009-03-11-The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:How do you design and handle peak load on the Cloud?by Cloudiquity.
Gives a formula to try and predict and plan for peak load and talks about how
GigaSpaces XAP, Scalr, RightScale and FreedomOSS can be used to handle peak
load within EC2.Theo Schlossnagle, with his usual insight, talks about
inDissecting today's surgeshow the nature of internet traffic has evolved over
time. Traffic now spikes like a heart attack, larger and more quickly than
ever from traffic inflow sources like Digg and The New York Times. Theo
relates howAt least eight times in the past month, we've experienced from 100%
to 1000% sudden increases in traffic across many of our clientsand those spike
can happen as quickly as 60 seconds. To me this sounds a lot likePunctuated

species...breakVMs don't spin up in less than 60 seconds so your ability to
respond to such massive quick spikes is limited. This assumes of course that
