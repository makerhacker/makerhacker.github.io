<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns

<p>Introduction: This a guest post byRajkumar Iyer, a Member of Technical Staff at
Aerospike.About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-
memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity
server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from
improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we
took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things -
performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community
Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published therecipefor how
we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.This year we continued the quest. Our
goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server;
more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra's boast of
1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million
dollars per year. Weachieved thiswithout kernel tuning. This article describes

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>6 0.085404471 <a title="1227-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability_Perspectives_%235%3A_Werner_Vogels_%E2%80%93_The_Amazon_Technology_Platform.html">480 high scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability Perspectives #5: Werner Vogels – The Amazon Technology Platform</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics
below. If you agree with a statement then you "take it"; if you disagree then
you "leave it." And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as
to why. Got it?Snowden vs. the State.Snowden represents true the spirit of
freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear.Walled Garden vs. Federated
Freedom.The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will
return the balance and federated services will once again win the day.Mobile +
messaging vs. Le Web.Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing
the way things are found, discovered, and bought.Fiat vs.
Cryptocurrency.BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it's on the
way out, a tulip gone out of bloom.True Detective vs. The Field.True Detective
is the best show on TV, ever.

BOM cost down. Here's a dream way of making that happen: Bye-Bye Batteries:
Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source. "Silicon technology has advanced to the
point where even tiny amounts of energy can do useful work." No batteries ==
cheaper, smaller products == ubiquity.The MySQL "swap insanity" problem and
the effects of the NUMA architecture. Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article
on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly
unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There
are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance
effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This
is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge.

Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second

over years as users and features have been added.Second Lifeis a 3-D virtual
world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>5 0.79459816 <a title="1227-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-11-Monday_Fun%3A_Seven_Databases_in_Song.html">1262 high scalability-2012-06-11-Monday Fun: Seven Databases in Song</a></p>
