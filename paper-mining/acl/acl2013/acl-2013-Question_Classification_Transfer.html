<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) and Answer Extraction are often designed as isolated or loosely connected components in Question Answering (QA), with repeated overengineering on IR, and not necessarily performance gain for QA. We propose to tightly integrate them by coupling automatically learned features for answer extraction to a shallow-structured IR model. Our method is very quick to implement, and significantly improves IR for QA (measured in Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank) by 10%-20% against an uncoupled retrieval baseline in both document and passage retrieval, which further leads to a downstream 20% improvement in QA F1.</p><p>3 0.24336585 <a title="292-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Statistical_Machine_Translation_Improves_Question_Retrieval_in_Community_Question_Answering_via_Matrix_Factorization.html">329 acl-2013-Statistical Machine Translation Improves Question Retrieval in Community Question Answering via Matrix Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Fang Liu ; Yang Liu ; Shizhu He ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Community question answering (CQA) has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this paper, we focus on the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in CQA can automatically find the most relevant and recent questions that have been solved by other users. However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issue. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via matrix factorization. Experiments conducted on a real CQA data show that our proposed approach is promising.</p><p>4 0.2217062 <a title="292-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.21530442 <a title="292-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Minimum_Bayes_Risk_based_Answer_Re-ranking_for_Question_Answering.html">241 acl-2013-Minimum Bayes Risk based Answer Re-ranking for Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: We study question answering as a machine learning problem, and induce a function that maps open-domain questions to queries over a database of web extractions. Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.</p><p>5 0.75186008 <a title="292-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Bad_Semantic_Neighbors_for_Improving_Distributional_Thesauri.html">185 acl-2013-Identifying Bad Semantic Neighbors for Improving Distributional Thesauri</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Ferret</p><p>Abstract: Distributional thesauri are now widely used in a large number of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, they are far from containing only interesting semantic relations. As a consequence, improving such thesaurus is an important issue that is mainly tackled indirectly through the improvement of semantic similarity measures. In this article, we propose a more direct approach focusing on the identification of the neighbors of a thesaurus entry that are not semantically linked to this entry. This identification relies on a discriminative classifier trained from unsupervised selected examples for building a distributional model of the entry in texts. Its bad neighbors are found by applying this classifier to a representative set of occurrences of each of these neighbors. We evaluate the interest of this method for a large set of English nouns with various frequencies.</p><p>6 0.75159103 <a title="292-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Microblogs_as_Parallel_Corpora.html">240 acl-2013-Microblogs as Parallel Corpora</a></p>
