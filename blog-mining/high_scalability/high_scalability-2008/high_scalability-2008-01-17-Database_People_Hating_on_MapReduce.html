<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce . PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.  It took six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000 computers  and the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.  Update:   Greg Linden  points to a new Google article  MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters . Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  Google is the King of scalability.  Everyone knows Google for their large,  sophisticated, and fast searching, but they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an alarmingly high competition crushing rate.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Update:   MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008 class  . Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example, the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through multiple generations of technology.   With Google entering the cloud space with  Google AppEngine  and a maturing  Hadoop  product, the MapReduce scaling approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable memory future.  Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  One common criticism ex-Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the Google environment.

<p>Introduction: As the Kings of scaling, when Google changes its search infrastructure over to do something completely different, it's news. In  Google search index splits with MapReduce , an exclusive interview by Cade Metz with Eisar Lipkovitz, a senior director of engineering at Google, we learn a bit more of the secret scaling sauce behind  Google Instant , Google's new faster, real-time search system.
 
The challenge for Google has been how to support a real-time world when the core of their search technology, the famous MapReduce, is batch oriented. Simple, they got rid of MapReduce. At least they got rid of MapReduce as the backbone for calculating search indexes. MapReduce still excels as a general query mechanism against masses of data, but real-time search requires a very specialized tool, and Google built one. Internally the successor to Google's famed Google File System, was code named Colossus.
 
Details are slowly coming out about their new goals and approach:

<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the term   NewSQL   , or pretty much any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talk    on Building Spanner   , that’s the term that fits Spanner best.  
 
 Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That seems NewSQL to me.    As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In an    earlier 2011 talk    given by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar: 
  
  There’s a false dichotomy between little complicated databases and huge, sca</p><p>5 0.73881459 <a title="216-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_20th%2C_2013.html">1567 high scalability-2013-12-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 20th, 2013</a></p>

David DeWitt writes in the Database Column that MapReduce is a major step backwards:     A giant step backward in the programming paradigm for large-scale data intensive applications   A sub-optimal implementation, in that it uses brute force instead of indexing   Not novel at all -- it represents a specific implementation of well known techniques developed nearly 25 years ago   Missing most of the features that are routinely included in current DBMS   Incompatible with all of the tools DBMS users have come to depend on  Listening to databasers and map reducers talk is like eavesdropping on your average family holiday mashup.

<p>Introduction: Hi...      I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am building it!  So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking, architecture planning, everything.  I haven't even gotten into the legal aspects yet.......     It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to handle that end of the operation.  I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best.  I'd like to FIND that very best person available, to handle the technical aspects.  For worse or better, I don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.     I've posted a bazillion ads on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses.  I've put out feelers among my own network, same result.  Not sure what else I can do.  Shoestring budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning.  That can actually be a plus, as it forces people to focus.     Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the right person?     Thanks   Jason</p><p>3 0.78451818 <a title="216-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable_is_a_New_BigTable_Clone_that_Runs_on_HDFS_or_KFS.html">647 high scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable is a New BigTable Clone that Runs on HDFS or KFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3 : Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video 1 ,  video 2 .
 
 Update 2 : The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that  Hypertable is now officially  sponsored by Baidu , China’s Leading Search Engine.  As a sponsor of Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the open source technology. 
 
 Update : InfoQ interview on  Hypertable Lead Discusses Hadoop and Distributed Databases . Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.
 
 Skrentablog  gives the heads up on  Hypertable ,  Zvents'  open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at  28M rows of data inserted at a per-node write rate of 7mb/sec .</p><p>4 0.65833521 <a title="216-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Sriram Devadas , Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of this post. 
 
I own a small coffee shop.   My expense is proportional to resources  100 square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.   My shop's capacity  Serves 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.   Since my barista works without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,  my shop's maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour.
       
 
  Web server  
Customers walk away during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to wait.   I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!
