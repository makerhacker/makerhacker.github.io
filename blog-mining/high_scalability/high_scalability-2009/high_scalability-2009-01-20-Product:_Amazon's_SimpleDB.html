<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web
services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the

FUD.Update:Top 10 Reasons to Avoid the SimpleDB Hypeby Ryan Park provides a
well written counter take. Am I really that fawning? If so, doesn't that make
me a dear?All your life you've used a relational database. At the tender age
of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance. Your
RDBMS allegiance was just assumed, like your politics or religion would have
been assumed 100 years ago. They now say--you know them--that relations won't
scale and we have to do things differently. New databases like SimpleDB and
BigTable are what's different. As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect
of SimpleDB? That's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover. Like
many brave explorers before him, Alex gave a report of his adventures to the
Royal Society of theAWS Meetup. Alex told a wild almost unbelievable tale of

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their
website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the
Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth "Sid" Anand,Netflix's
Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems, gives a detailed look at this
transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing
especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a
RDBMS.Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would
appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please
comment here or email Sid atr39132@hotmail.com or Twitter at @r39132 Here's
the introduction from the paper:Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data
center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-
failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability - data center outages meant
interruptions to service and negative customer impact. Additionally, with

<p>Introduction: Not surprisingly opinions onSimpleDBvary from it sucks, don't take my
database, to it will change the world, who needs a database anyway? From
aquick survey of the blogosphere, here's where SimpleDB stands at the
moment:SimpleDB ConsNo SLA. We don't know how reliable it will be, how fast it
will be, or how consistent the performance will be.Consistency constraints are
relaxed. Reading data immediately after a write may not reflect the latest
updates. To programmers used to transactions, this may be surprising, but many
people think this is one of the tradeoffs that needs to be made to
scale.Database is a core competency. If you don't control your database you
can't out compete your competition.When your database is out of your control
you can't guarantee it will work properly. You can't create the proper indexes
and other optimizations.No join or IN operator. You'll need to do multiple
client side calls to simulate joins, which will be slow.No stored procedures,

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>4 0.89585578 <a title="498-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_3%2C_2012.html">1187 high scalability-2012-02-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 3, 2012</a></p>
