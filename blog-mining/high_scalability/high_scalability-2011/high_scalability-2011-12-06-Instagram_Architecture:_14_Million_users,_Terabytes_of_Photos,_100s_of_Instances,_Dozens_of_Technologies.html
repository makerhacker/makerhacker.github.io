<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard Facebook will Buy Photo-
Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo

<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with
recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem. The problem being that
if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be
used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from
widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the
details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?). If you have
100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.I can see
why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching? i.e. If you run the
first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it
from the cache. Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good? Assuming of course
that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the
cache.I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously
implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data that are in use

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability
problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting
tasks. The post was written byMaarten Ectors, responsible for Cloud Strategy
andFrank Mueller, a Juju Core developer, at Ubuntu/Canonical.High-availability
and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that
experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up
MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster,
monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating
Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,â&euro;Ś Why are we reinventing the wheel?At Ubuntu we
made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring
tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What
