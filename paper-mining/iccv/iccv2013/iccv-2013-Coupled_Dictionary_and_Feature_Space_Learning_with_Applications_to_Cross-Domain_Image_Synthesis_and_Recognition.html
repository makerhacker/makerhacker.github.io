<p>Author: Chih-Yuan Yang, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: The goal of single-image super-resolution is to generate a high-quality high-resolution image based on a given low-resolution input. It is an ill-posed problem which requires exemplars or priors to better reconstruct the missing high-resolution image details.

The use of split input space facilitates both feasibility of using simple functionsfor super-resolution, and efficiency ofgenerating highresolution results.

<p>Author: Netalee Efrat, Daniel Glasner, Alexander Apartsin, Boaz Nadler, Anat Levin</p><p>Abstract: Over the past decade, single image Super-Resolution (SR) research has focused on developing sophisticated image priors, leading to significant advances. Estimating and incorporating the blur model, that relates the high-res and low-res images, has received much less attention, however. In particular, the reconstruction constraint, namely that the blurred and downsampled high-res output should approximately equal the low-res input image, has been either ignored or applied with default fixed blur models. In this work, we examine the relative importance ofthe imageprior and the reconstruction constraint. First, we show that an accurate reconstruction constraint combined with a simple gradient regularization achieves SR results almost as good as those of state-of-the-art algorithms with sophisticated image priors. Second, we study both empirically and theoretically the sensitivity of SR algorithms to the blur model assumed in the reconstruction constraint. We find that an accurate blur model is more important than a sophisticated image prior. Finally, using real camera data, we demonstrate that the default blur models of various SR algorithms may differ from the camera blur, typically leading to over- smoothed results. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately estimating camera blur in reconstructing raw low- res images acquired by an actual camera.</p><p>4 0.14869298 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./iccv-2013-Anchored_Neighborhood_Regression_for_Fast_Example-Based_Super-Resolution.html">51 iccv-2013-Anchored Neighborhood Regression for Fast Example-Based Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Radu Timofte, Vincent De_Smet, Luc Van_Gool</p><p>Abstract: Recently there have been significant advances in image upscaling or image super-resolution based on a dictionary of low and high resolution exemplars. The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact that it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast super-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we support the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor embedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the correlation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. Moreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for the right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has considerable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a precomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood regression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution patch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding embedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of- the-art methods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two orders of magnitude speed improvements.</p><p>5 0.14026688 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./iccv-2013-A_New_Image_Quality_Metric_for_Image_Auto-denoising.html">23 iccv-2013-A New Image Quality Metric for Image Auto-denoising</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiangfei Kong, Kuan Li, Qingxiong Yang, Liu Wenyin, Ming-Hsuan Yang</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new non-reference image quality metric that can be adopted by the state-of-the-art image/video denoising algorithms for auto-denoising. The proposed metric is extremely simple and can be implemented in four lines of Matlab code1. The basic assumption employed by the proposed metric is that the noise should be independent of the original image. A direct measurement of this dependence is, however, impractical due to the relatively low accuracy of existing denoising method. The proposed metric thus aims at maximizing the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the estimated image noise around homogeneous regions and the structure similarity between the input noisy image and the denoised image around highly-structured regions, and is computed as the linear correlation coefficient of the two corresponding structure similarity maps. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed metric not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art non-reference quality metric quantitatively and qualitatively, but also better maintains temporal coherence when used for video denoising. ˜</p><p>6 0.12580256 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./iccv-2013-Nonparametric_Blind_Super-resolution.html">293 iccv-2013-Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Emmanuel J. Candès</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework to super-resolve planar regions found in urban scenes and other man-made environments by taking into account their 3D geometry. Such regions have highly structured straight edges, but this prior is challenging to exploit due to deformations induced by the projection onto the imaging plane. Our method factors out such deformations by using recently developed tools based on convex optimization to learn a transform that maps the image to a domain where its gradient has a simple group-sparse structure. This allows to obtain a novel convex regularizer that enforces global consistency constraints between the edges of the image. Computational experiments with real images show that this data-driven approach to the design of regularizers promoting transform-invariant group sparsity is very effective at high super-resolution factors. We view our approach as complementary to most recent superresolution methods, which tend to focus on hallucinating high-frequency textures.</p><p>6 0.53525567 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./iccv-2013-Nonparametric_Blind_Super-resolution.html">293 iccv-2013-Nonparametric Blind Super-resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohit Gupta, Daisuke Iso, Shree K. Nayar</p><p>Abstract: Exposure bracketing for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging involves capturing several images of the scene at different exposures. If either the camera or the scene moves during capture, the captured images must be registered. Large exposure differences between bracketed images lead to inaccurate registration, resulting in artifacts such as ghosting (multiple copies of scene objects) and blur. We present two techniques, one for image capture (Fibonacci exposure bracketing) and one for image registration (generalized registration), to prevent such motion-related artifacts. Fibonacci bracketing involves capturing a sequence of images such that each exposure time is the sum of the previous N(N > 1) exposures. Generalized registration involves estimating motion between sums of contiguous sets of frames, instead of between individual frames. Together, the two techniques ensure that motion is always estimated betweenframes of the same total exposure time. This results in HDR images and videos which have both a large dynamic range andminimal motion-relatedartifacts. We show, by results for several real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, that theproposed approach significantly outperforms several ex- isting bracketing schemes.</p><p>2 0.72189963 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./iccv-2013-Simultaneous_Clustering_and_Tracklet_Linking_for_Multi-face_Tracking_in_Videos.html">393 iccv-2013-Simultaneous Clustering and Tracklet Linking for Multi-face Tracking in Videos</a></p>
<p>Author: Baoyuan Wu, Siwei Lyu, Bao-Gang Hu, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel method that simultaneously clusters and associates short sequences of detected faces (termed as face tracklets) in videos. The rationale of our method is that face tracklet clustering and linking are related problems that can benefit from the solutions of each other. Our method is based on a hidden Markov random field model that represents the joint dependencies of cluster labels and tracklet linking associations . We provide an efficient algorithm based on constrained clustering and optimal matching for the simultaneous inference of cluster labels and tracklet associations. We demonstrate significant improvements on the state-of-the-art results in face tracking and clustering performances on several video datasets.</p><p>3 0.71535838 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./iccv-2013-Learning_Slow_Features_for_Behaviour_Analysis.html">243 iccv-2013-Learning Slow Features for Behaviour Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Lazaros Zafeiriou, Mihalis A. Nicolaou, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Symeon Nikitidis, Maja Pantic</p><p>Abstract: A recently introduced latent feature learning technique for time varying dynamic phenomena analysis is the socalled Slow Feature Analysis (SFA). SFA is a deterministic component analysis technique for multi-dimensional sequences that by minimizing the variance of the first order time derivative approximation of the input signal finds uncorrelated projections that extract slowly-varying features ordered by their temporal consistency and constancy. In this paper, we propose a number of extensions in both the deterministic and the probabilistic SFA optimization frameworks. In particular, we derive a novel deterministic SFA algorithm that is able to identify linear projections that extract the common slowest varying features of two or more sequences. In addition, we propose an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to perform inference in a probabilistic formulation of SFA and similarly extend it in order to handle two and more time varying data sequences. Moreover, we demonstrate that the probabilistic SFA (EMSFA) algorithm that discovers the common slowest varying latent space of multiple sequences can be combined with dynamic time warping techniques for robust sequence timealignment. The proposed SFA algorithms were applied for facial behavior analysis demonstrating their usefulness and appropriateness for this task.</p><p>4 0.70467436 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./iccv-2013-Unsupervised_Random_Forest_Manifold_Alignment_for_Lipreading.html">437 iccv-2013-Unsupervised Random Forest Manifold Alignment for Lipreading</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuru Pei, Tae-Kyun Kim, Hongbin Zha</p><p>Abstract: Lipreading from visual channels remains a challenging topic considering the various speaking characteristics. In this paper, we address an efficient lipreading approach by investigating the unsupervised random forest manifold alignment (RFMA). The density random forest is employed to estimate affinity of patch trajectories in speaking facial videos. We propose novel criteria for node splitting to avoid the rank-deficiency in learning density forests. By virtue of the hierarchical structure of random forests, the trajectory affinities are measured efficiently, which are used to find embeddings of the speaking video clips by a graph-based algorithm. Lipreading is formulated as matching between manifolds of query and reference video clips. We employ the manifold alignment technique for matching, where the L∞norm-based manifold-to-manifold distance is proposed to find the matching pairs. We apply this random forest manifold alignment technique to various video data sets captured by consumer cameras. The experiments demonstrate that lipreading can be performed effectively, and outperform state-of-the-arts.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.696495 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./iccv-2013-Coupled_Dictionary_and_Feature_Space_Learning_with_Applications_to_Cross-Domain_Image_Synthesis_and_Recognition.html">96 iccv-2013-Coupled Dictionary and Feature Space Learning with Applications to Cross-Domain Image Synthesis and Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: De-An Huang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</p><p>Abstract: Cross-domain image synthesis and recognition are typically considered as two distinct tasks in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. Therefore, it is not clear whether approaches addressing one task can be easily generalized or extended for solving the other. In this paper, we propose a unified model for coupled dictionary and feature space learning. The proposed learning model not only observes a common feature space for associating cross-domain image data for recognition purposes, the derived feature space is able to jointly update the dictionaries in each image domain for improved representation. This is why our method can be applied to both cross-domain image synthesis and recognition problems. Experiments on a variety of synthesis and recognition tasks such as single image super-resolution, cross-view action recognition, and sketchto-photo face recognition would verify the effectiveness of our proposed learning model.</p><p>6 0.68722028 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./iccv-2013-Contextual_Hypergraph_Modeling_for_Salient_Object_Detection.html">91 iccv-2013-Contextual Hypergraph Modeling for Salient Object Detection</a></p>
