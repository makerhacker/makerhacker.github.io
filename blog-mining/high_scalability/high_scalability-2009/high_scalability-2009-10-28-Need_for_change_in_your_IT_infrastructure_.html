<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the
question that immediately came to mind whenJames Urquhart, in an interview at
the Stata Conference, made this thought provoking comment:the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money
you save overall.One of the many super powers of the cloud iselasticity, the
ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand.
But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not
quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to
explore this contradiction.In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals
itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as
1-3 minutes, or can average 5-10 minutes, or it can take much longer if
there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common
complaint about Google App Engine is thecold-start problem. When a request

<p>Introduction: Scalability forces us to think differently. What worked on a small scale
doesn't always work on a large scale -- and costs are no different. If 90% of
our application is free of contention, and only 10% is spent on a shared
resources, we will need to grow our compute resources by a factor of 100 to
scale by a factor of 10! Another important thing to note is that 10x, in this
case, is the limit of our ability to scale, even if more resources are
added.1. The cost of non-linearly scalable applications grows exponentially
with the demand for more scale.2. Non-linearly scalable applications have an
absolute limit of scalability. According to Amdhal's Law, with 10% contention,
the maximum scaling limit is 10. With 40% contention, our maximum scaling
limit is 2.5 - no matter how many hardware resources we will throw at the
problem.This post discuss in further details how to measure the true cost of
non linearly scalable systems and suggest a model for reducing that cost
significantly.</p><p>6 0.069924667 <a title="731-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-04-Business_continuity_with_real-time_data_integration.html">822 high scalability-2010-05-04-Business continuity with real-time data integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most important architectural decisions that must be done early on
in a scalable web site project issplitting the data flow into two streams: one
that is user specific and one that is generic. If this is done properly, the
system will be able to grow easily. On the other hand, if the data streams are
not separated from the start, then the growth options will be severely
limited. Trying to make such a web site scale will be just painting the
corpse, and this change will cost a whole lot more when you need to introduce
it later (and it is "when" in this case, not "if").</p><p>3 0.69904435 <a title="731-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>

answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,

Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access

<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume
that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a
short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs
depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I
generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.The driving
forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business
requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software
development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business
unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new
products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software
system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution
to whatever problems lay ahead.Given that many businesses can be identified as
having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe

<p>Introduction: Hi,I saw an year ago that Netapp sold netcache to blu-coat, my site is a heavy
NetCache user and we cached 83% of our site. We tested with Blue-coat and F5
WA and we are not getting same performce as NetCache.Any of you guys have the
same issue? or somebody knows another product can handle much
traffic?ThanksRodrigo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.76175714 <a title="731-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-Need_for_change_in_your_IT_infrastructure_.html">731 high scalability-2009-10-28-Need for change in your IT infrastructure </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstripforecasts, consumer confidence is retuning and city
bonuses areback. What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent
years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from
increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have
lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time
analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be
crying out "The engine canna take no more captain". What can be done?.entry-
bodyWhat we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system
that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There
are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS
as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally
with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it
is "enough" to purchase twice the hardware.This is linear growth. Is it enough

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>4 0.73940593 <a title="731-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>
<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions? CTL d</p><p>5 0.72682565 <a title="731-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use
